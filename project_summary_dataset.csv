But for gymnastics, you have to be both, consistent and brave. It has taken me a while to reach where I am. You have to do it every day. Only when you break your bones and knees do you reach somewhere.”

“These are the kind of things you should be doing. You’ll regret not correcting those things early like I did. I don’t want you to waste two-three years of your career. You have to play more than what you have played,” the Indian skipper further said.

The Pakistani leader made these comments at the United States Institute of Peace during his three-day visit to the nation.
Khan also said that before his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government came into power, the governments did not have the “political will” to disarm militant groups operating on their soil.
“There was a watershed in Pakistani politics. In 2014, the Pakistani Taliban slaughtered 150 school children at Army Public School. All the political parties signed the National Action Plan and we all decided after that, that we will not allow any militant groups to operate inside Pakistan,” Khan said.
“Until we came into power, the governments did not have the political will, because when you talk about militant groups we still have about 30,000-40,000 armed people who have been trained and fought in some part of Afghanistan or Kashmir,” he revealed.
“We are the first government that has started disarming militant groups. This is the first time it’s happening. We’ve taken over their institutes, their seminaries. We have administrators there,” he added.
During a separate event, the Pakistani Prime Minister also said that they had 40 different militant groups operating within its borders.
He also claimed that previous governments were not in control and did not tell the US about the exact “truth on the ground.”
“We were fighting the US war on terror. Pakistan has nothing to do with 9/11. Al-Qaeda was in Afghanistan. There were no militant Taliban in Pakistan. But we joined the US war. Unfortunately, when things went wrong, where I blame my government, we did not tell the US exactly the truth on the ground,” Khan told US lawmakers at the Capitol Hill.
“Part of the reason was, our governments were not in control. There were 40 different militant groups operating within Pakistan,” he stated.
“So Pakistan went through a period where people like us were worried about could we survive it. So while the US expected us to do more and help the US win the war, Pakistan at that time was fighting for its own existence,” Khan added.

Nandini Sinha,Russia expressed deep regret for airspace intrusion: South Korea,"A Russian official has expressed ""deep regret"" after one of the country's military aircraft intruded into South Korean airspace, South Korea's presidential office said.

A Russian military aircraft entered airspace near a group of islets claimed by both South Korea and Japan on Tuesday, during a long-range joint air patrol with Chinese jets, according to South Korea and Japan, which both scrambled fighter jets in response.
South Korean warplanes fired flares and hundreds of warning shots near the Russian aircraft, and the incident triggered a round of diplomatic protests by countries in the region.
An unidentified Russian military attache in Seoul told South Korean officials on Tuesday that the plane appeared to have “entered an unplanned area due to a device malfunction”, said Yoon Do-han, South Korea’s presidential press secretary.
“Russia has conveyed its deep regret over the incident and said its defence ministry would immediately launch an investigation and take all necessary steps,” Yoon said.
“The officer said such a situation would have never occurred if it followed the initially planned route.”
Hours later, Russia’s embassy in Seoul said there had been no apology.
“The Russian side did not make an official apology,” the embassy in Seoul said, adding it had noted many inaccuracies in the comments by South Korea, Interfax reported.
The incident comes at a delicate time for a region that has for years been overshadowed by hostility between the United States and North Korea and has recently seen a flare-up in tension between South Korea and Japan.
Russia’s public statements on the issue have not mentioned any technical problems, nor has Russia announced any investigation or acknowledged a violation of South Korean airspace.
Yoon said in a later briefing that after the attache admitted a possible mistake and expressed regret, which was taken as Moscow’s official position, Russia “altered” its account by sending a document stating that it did not violate any airspace.
Russia also accused South Korean fighter jets of threatening the safety of Russian aircraft by interfering with their flight and failing to communicate, Yoon said.

The Supreme Court criticised the lenders for failing to monitor the end use of loans to the company, one of several developers in India to hit financial trouble in recent years after a decade-long building boom.
More than 40,000 homebuyers are suing Amrapali in a long running legal battle over delays to projects, many of which have not yet been started even though customers have made payments.
“The authorities and bankers have violated the doctrine of public trust and their officials, unfortunately, acted in collusion with builders,” a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court said on Tuesday, referring to state development authorities.
The Bank of Baroda and Corporation Bank — Amrapali lenders criticised by the court — did not respond to requests for comment.
A court-ordered forensic audit of Amrapali released in May said the firm defrauded its customers out of around 35 billion rupees ($507.88 million) by diverting home buyers’ funds. It also said that loans taken by banks had also been diverted by the promoters to increase their own personal wealth. Amrapali has not commented on the audit.
A government-run construction company has been delegated with completing the unfinished projects of the group.

Krishna Veera Vanamali,29-yr-old postpones $4.5 mn lunch with Buffett due to kidney stones,"Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun postponed his $4.57 million charity lunch with Warren Buffett after falling ill with kidney stones. The 29-year-old, who founded Tron cryptocurrency, denied reports that he was involved in illegal fundraising and money laundering. Sun added a report by a Chinese publication stating he had been barred from leaving the country was ""completely false"".",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-buffett-lunch-delay/warren-buffetts-charity-lunch-postponed-after-cryptocurrency-promoter-falls-ill-idUSKCN1UI0K1?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Sun had been scheduled to dine with Buffett on July 25 at the Michelin-starred Quince restaurant in San Francisco after he won an auction to benefit Glide, a charity in the city.
Sun’s Tron Foundation said all parties have agreed to reschedule the lunch. Buffett’s assistant did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Buffett, the billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), has long been a skeptic of cryptocurrency.
He once called bitcoin “probably rat poison squared,” and at Berkshire’s annual meeting in May likened wagering on bitcoin to betting on zero or double-zero on a Las Vegasroulette wheel.
Sun had said that he hoped dining with Buffett would “bridge the gap between institutional and traditional investors and the realm of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.” Buffett has raised about $34.2 million for Glide, a charity that serves the poor, homeless and those battling substance abuse, in 20 annual auctions since 2000. Glide said on Tuesday it has received Sun’s entire donation.
Sun on Tuesday denied a Chinese media report suggesting he engaged in improper activities in China.
He wrote on his Weibo social media account that rumors circulating online about illegal fundraising and about money laundering were untrue, and that Singapore-based Tron complied with local laws there.
Later on Wednesday, he said a report by Chinese financial magazine Caixin, stating he had been barred from foreign travel by Chinese authorities, was “completely false”.
Tron launched its TRX token in 2017, raising about $70 million in an initial coin offering, and acquired San Francisco-based BitTorrent for $120 million last year. It has said its goal is to establish a decentralized internet.
Tron’s cryptocurrency was down 11.2% on Tuesday afternoon, according to the website CoinMarketCap.com, giving it a value of about $1.68 billion.

Apple has lured over another big name from its potential rival, with Steve MacManus, the former Vice President of Engineering at Tesla, joining the company.
MacManus was responsible for the engineering of the interior of Tesla vehicles and has also worked for other big companies in the automotive industry like Aston Martin, Jaguar and Bentley & Land Rover. He is now a Senior Director at Apple. The move was highlighted by Bloomberg and is confirmed on MacManus' LinkedIn profile.
Apple has long been rumored to be working on its own autonomous vehicle as part of its electric car project Project Titan. The company has been active in the automotive sector recently, acquiring self-driving startup drive.ai last month. Hiring MacManus could be an indication that Apple intends to design its own vehicle in the future, or it could be that the company intends to apply his design skills to other Apple products.
While there is often exchange of engineers between Apple and Tesla, this hiring at the executive level has analysts wondering if the companies could have plans for some kind of joint project. Two other executives have made the move from Tesla to Apple in the last year -- Michael Schwekutsch, the former head of electric powertrains, and Doug Field, former senior VP of engineering.

In a two-part tweet, the Uttar Pradesh (East) Congress in-charge late on Tuesday tweeted, “One day the BJP will discover that everything cannot be bought, everyone cannot be bullied and every lie is eventually exposed..”
She further said, “Until then I suppose, the citizens of our country will have to endure their unbridled corruption, the systematic dismantling of institutions that protect the people’s interests and the weakening of a democracy that took decades of toil and sacrifice to build.”
Priyanka’s remarks come after the Congress-JD(S) government lost the trust vote on the floor of the Karnataka Assembly by six votes after a four-day debate on the confidence motion that was moved by Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy.
Of the 225-member Assembly, 20 legislators were absent for the floor test, reducing the House strength to 205 with 103 as the halfway mark for simple majority. In the division of votes, 99 were for the motion and 105 against it.
Of the 20 legislators who were absent for the floor test, 15 were rebels of the Congress-JD(S) coalition, two Congress members who are in private hospitals in the city and in Mumbai for treatment, two Independents and one Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) member.
Soon after the floor test, BSP supremo Mayawati expelled N. Mahesh, the party’s MLA from Kollegal in Karnataka, for abstaining from voting.

Nandini Sinha,Mark Esper sworn in as US Defence Secretary,"Army veteran Mark Esper was sworn in as the US' Defence Secretary on Tuesday following confirmation by the Senate. Esper succeeds James Mattis, who resigned in December last year following differences with US President Donald Trump over the withdrawal of American troops from Syria. Esper has also worked as a lobbyist for the military contractor firm Raytheon.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/23/mark-esper-sworn-in-as-us-defense-secretary-following-record-vacancy?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Mark Esper, an army veteran and former defense industry lobbyist, was sworn in as the US secretary of defense after receiving Senate confirmation on Tuesday.
Esper’s confirmation, by a vote of 90-8, comes after a seven-month vacancy in the post. He was sworn in hours later at the White House by the supreme court justice Samuel Alito in a ceremony attended by Donald Trump.
“He’s going to be a great one,” Trump predicted at the swearing-in.
Esper will succeed the Marine general Jim “Mad Dog” Mattis. His confirmation ends a record stretch for the Pentagon without a secretary of defense, which began when Mattis stepped down last December after clashing with Trump over the withdrawal of US troops from Syria and Afghanistan.
Trump initially nominated Patrick Shanahan, who served as acting secretary of defense until the disclosure of domestic violence incidents within his family caused the former Boeing executive to withdraw from the nomination process in June.
One of the central questions facing Esper is whether he can settle the Pentagon’s leadership turmoil. Several key leadership posts are vacant or will be imminently, including deputy secretary of defense, vice-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and head of US Strategic Command.
The larger question for Esper, who served as secretary of the army in 2017 after leaving the private sector, will be the unfolding crisis with Iran.
Esper has a wide range of experience in defense matters, including time on Capitol Hill as a congressional staff member.
He also has some first-hand knowledge of the region, having served in the 101st airborne division and participated in the 1990-91 Gulf war. He later served as the deputy assistant secretary of defense for negotiations policy during the George W Bush administration.
Esper worked was a lobbyist for Raytheon, a major defense contractor, for several years before becoming army secretary. He has said he intends to continue the Trump administration’s focus on improving the combat preparedness of the military, nurturing security alliances around the world, and reforming Pentagon business practices.
“Esper’s background is in the military and in the private sector at Raytheon working with the Pentagon, but not in negotiating a delicate settlement with a country the US has a checkered relationship with,” Carl Tobias, a professor of law at the University of Richmond, told the Guardian.
 “I don’t know how much of a diplomat or statesman he is and that’s what this is all about – finding some way to tamp down the tension that’s so high right now.”
The big question is whether Esper can improve the Pentagon’s influence within the administration and counter the influence of Iran hawks, including the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and the national security adviser, John Bolton.
“First off, he has to get in to the good graces of the president and move the president away from some of the pressure from Bolton and Pompeo, to back down a little and not confront Iran all the time,” added Tobias. “Maybe he’s smart enough to know how to navigate that and has a pragmatic view of what this could lead to because he’s been there.”
At a minimum, Esper’s rapid confirmation suggests the Senate would rather have him in place than an empty post.
Eight Democratic senators voted against Esper’s nomination, including the 2020 presidential hopeful Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been sharply critical of him for declining to recuse himself from all matters involving Raytheon for the duration of his government service.
“This smacks of corruption, plain and simple,” Warren said at the confirmation hearing. “Will you commit that during your time as defense secretary that you will not seek any waiver that will allow you to participate in matters that affect Raytheon’s financial interests?” Esper said he would not.
The Democratic representative Adam Smith, who is chairman of the House armed services committee, said he was encouraged by Esper’s confirmation but worried by the continuing problem of vacancies in the Pentagon.
“The complex challenges that we face around the globe are too serious for key positions at the Department of Defense to remain transient,” Smith said.
“Instead, our country needs predictable leadership at the Pentagon, capable of withstanding internal political pressure in what has been a historically turbulent administration.”

Daisy Mowke,No one picked on 'Sanju' when he says he slept with 300 girls: Shahid,"Speaking about 'Kabir Singh' being accused of glorifying 'toxic masculinity', Shahid Kapoor said, ""'Sanju' had a scene where the guy [says] he has slept with over 300 women. No one picked on it the way they went after 'Kabir Singh'"". However, Shahid added he ""thoroughly enjoyed"" 'Sanju' because he ""didn't watch it to see how people should be.""",https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/shahid-kapoor-on-kabir-singh-no-one-should-be-allowed-to-tell-adults-which-film-to-watch-or-not-watch/story-toIvHtXo4z2ZHfZihpjgbM.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Shahid Kapoor talks in fewer words than most others. That he still manages to make plenty of sense in them sets the 38-year-old actor apart. One would think that the incredible commercial success of his latest release, Kabir Singh, (Rs 275 crore in five weeks and counting) would make the reticent star open up a bit more. Measured, sensible and logical he stays, in fewer words, but with sincerity.
Kabir Singh has crossed all your previous box office milestones. Has the success sunk in?
What has happened in the last five weeks is unreal. It’s too much to absorb and assimilate. There’s too much to think about. A lot to feel.
A lot to defend also, considering that while the film became a super hit, it also got wide criticism for glorifying misogyny through your character.
The fun of being an actor is when you get to play someone who is far removed from your real self. In real life, I could never be like Kabir Singh in any possible way. The challenge therefore was to find those grey strands in the personality, take a magnifying glass to enlarge them and bring them to life on screen. Those elements were also in the original Telugu film, Arjun Reddy, and that’s why I insisted that the same director be retained for the Hindi remake. I’ve never been afraid of playing characters that would be disliked. My drug addict character of Tommy Singh in Udta Punjab was also quite deplorable. I feel that people should walk out of the hall loving a performance, not the character. One needs to, therefore, make bold choices. For a star who is otherwise liked and loved, it’s a big thing if people watch a character on screen and wonder what the hell he is doing. It’s a huge compliment for me if people disliked Kabir Singh. To be able to lead people into a willing suspension of belief is the biggest victory for a film.
Were there also concerns that since you were remaking Arjun Reddy that had already been super hit in the South, that there’ll be comparisons, and the same misogyny debate that it had to face?
The fears were to do with the fact that we were making Kabir Singh for a much wider audience than Arjun Reddy had. The challenge was to rediscover and recreate the magic without losing the soul. Because unlike remakes which are story driven or plot driven, this remake was character driven. It was led and fronted by the performance of Kabir Singh’s character, and the challenge was to make him come alive. And when I saw the original, I loved it and didn’t feel like changing the soul of the character. Why fix it when it ain’t broke? But I still wanted to bring the elements of my originality to them. So it was a struggle every day.
Your film’s director Sandeep Vanga Reddy’s statement that it’s okay for people in love to slap each other went too far when it comes to defending a film, don’t you think?
It’s healthy that people disagree in society. It’s healthy for people to have strong points of view. Cinema is a platform to make conversations happen, for society to reflect upon itself, for people to be able to say that I don’t agree with you. The fact that people reacted so strongly to Sandeep’s statement is actually a testimony that the product, the film was so potent. That people actually started to feel that Kabir and Preeti (played by Kiara Advani) is a real couple who behave like this with each other. It’s a big compliment. I’m totally okay that people have issues with Kabir. I have issues with Kabir. I would never want to behave like he did. But then I am the actor who has to play the part.
The critics of the film were offended to the extent of telling viewers that whoever watches Kabir Singh is a supporter of toxic masculinity. Your thoughts?
See, when Kabir Singh was made, it wasn’t with any propaganda in mind. We were not trying to propagate something. It was a reflection of things that happen. Of people that exist. Of behavior that’s common human behavior. You see these things actually happen around you. The intent was to show it how it is. The prerogative to watch, not watch, like, dislike lies with the viewer. It takes a lot of courage to do something like what we did. I recently saw a High Court ruling that told the Certification Board that your task is certification, and not trying to censor. You’ve given ‘Adult’ rating to our film. This means that people who will watch it would be people who can vote, who can get a driving license, who can decide things for themselves. So I don’t think anyone can be in a privileged position to tell an adult what they can watch and what they can’t – what they must watch and what they mustn’t. That’s like putting yourself on a pedestal. I don’t think anyone – be it actors, filmmakers, reviewers, journalists – should be allowed to take that kind of a privileged mantle for themselves. People must decide for themselves.

Dutch media said Hauer was buried at a private ceremony. His family was not immediately available for comment. The much-admired Dutch actor got his first break in 1969 when he was cast in a historical Dutch television series called ""Floris"" directed by the then little known Paul Verhoeven. It triggered a years-long collaboration between the two, although it was said they fell out in the mid-80s.
Verhoeven cast Hauer in his first major film role in ""Turkish Delight"" in 1973. But it was when Hauer was teamed up with Hollywood star Sylvester Stallone in the 1981 thriller ""Nighthawks"" that he first came to the attention of US audiences.
The following year he appeared as Batty, model number N6MAA10816, the leader of the renegade Nexus-6 replicants in ""Blade Runner"" which made him one of Hollywood's film icons.
Speaking about Hauer's death, Verhoeven told the Dutch ANP news wire: ""I have lost my alter ego. ""I am extremely sad that he's not with us anymore. I am going to miss him terribly,"" Verhoeven said.

The producers expected me to scale up the humour and I have but it’s very situational. In fact, there are times when the character’s anger will make people laugh. Though I’ll be voicing the character, they won’t see me in it.”

Tripathi, who had been a Congress legislator, had switched over to the BJP in 2014. The legislator claimed that the second BJP MLA to support the Kamal Nath government’s bill is Sharad Kol. The two bonus votes for the Congress-led coalition government came hours after a back and forth between chief minister Kamal Nath and the leader of opposition in the assembly Gopal Bhargava over the stability of the coalition. The BJP’s Gopal Bhargava, speaking against the backdrop of the collapse of the HD Kumaraswamy government in Karnataka, had claimed that the opposition could pull down the Kamal Nath government at any time. The only reason that the Congress-led coalition had survived was because he hadn’t received his orders from the party leadership in Delhi. Nath shot back, pointing that this was probably because the party’s top two bosses were “wiser” than he was. He also dared Bhargava to try a no confidence motion against the government if he was so inclined. The extra vote from the two BJP lawmakers came soon after. The amendment to the criminal procedure code was supported by 122 MLAs though the state’s ruling coalition only has the support of 120 MLAs (excluding the speaker). Narayan Tripathi came out in the open soon after. He spoke about how there had been efforts to sabotage his election from within the BJP and how the last Shivraj Chouhan government only made announcements but didn’t deliver. “During the then BJP government, there were only assurances but no development work was done in my constituency Maihar,” he told reporters. The BJP’s Gopal Bhargava, who was taken aback by the outcome, initially tried to suggest that the party hadn’t issued a whip against the bill and so, the vote really didn’t matter. But the BJP, which has 108 MLAs in the assembly, hadn’t participated in the vote. “We have to see what transpired between them,” he said, when asked about the defection by the MLA. Kamal Nath was unsparing in his takedown of the state BJP leaders. “Every day the BJP says we are a minority government that can fall any day. Today during voting in the assembly, 2 BJP MLAs voted in favour of our government,” he said."

Patel previously served as Secretary of State for International Development, but was forced to resign in 2017.",https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/priti-patel-takes-charge-as-britains-first-indian-origin-home-secretary/1655596/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Patel had been a prominent member of the ""Back Boris"" campaign for the Conservative Party leadership and was widely tipped for the plum post in the prime minister's frontline team. Priti Patel, an ardent Brexiteer who was among the most vocal critics of Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, took charge as Britain’s first Indian-origin home secretary as part of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s top team on Thursday. She replaces Pakistani-origin Sajid Javid, who moves to the Treasury department as the first ethnic minority Chancellor of the Exchequer. “I will do everything in my power to keep our country safe, our people secure, and also to fight the scourge of crime that we see on our streets. I look forward to the challenges that now lie ahead,” Patel said, in reference to her new job at the helm of the UK Home Office. Patel had been a prominent member of the “Back Boris” campaign for the Conservative Party leadership and was widely tipped for the plum post in the prime minister’s frontline team. “It is important that the cabinet should represent modern Britain as well as a modern Conservative Party,” she said, hours before her appointment was announced on Wednesday. A long-standing Eurosceptic, Patel had steered the “Vote Leave” campaign in the lead-up to the June, 2016 referendum in favour of Britain’s exit from the European Union (EU). The 47-year-old was first elected as a Conservative MP for Witham in Essex in 2010 and gained prominence in the then David Cameron-led Tory government as his Indian Diaspora Champion. She went on to be appointed to junior ministerial posts, treasury minister in 2014 and then employment minister after the 2015 general election, before May promoted her to the position of secretary of state in the Department for International Development (DfID) in 2016, until she was forced to quit the post in 2017. “With Boris Johnson leading the Conservative Party and as prime minister, the United Kingdom will have a leader who believes in Britain, will implement a new vision for the future of the country and a roadmap to move forward and thrive as a self-governing nation that re-establishes our ties with our friends and allies around the world such as India,” Patel told PTI after Johnson secured a landslide victory in the Tory leadership contest earlier this week. “He is committed to securing new and improved trading relationship with our friends in India and ensuring that the values we share — the rule of law, democracy, and dynamic entrepreneurial spirit — should be at the heart of one of our most important partners on the global stage,” Patel, who has been a champion of India-UK ties ever since her time as Indian Diaspora Champion, said. The Gujarati-origin politician, who is a prominent guest at all major Indian diaspora events in the UK, is seen as an avid supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the UK. As a member of the UK Parliament’s influential Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC), she was part of the team that recently released its damning report warning that the UK was falling behind in the race to engage with India at the end of a lengthy Global Britain and India parliamentary inquiry. “Our report calls for the government to look again at the relationship between the UK and India,” Patel said, in reference to the “Building Bridges: Reawakening UK-India ties” report released last month to mark the first-ever India Day in the UK Parliament. “This should be a special relationship based upon the living bridge between our two great countries and a partnership we should be nurturing. The report covers many of the missed opportunities where the UK should be proactively and bilaterally enhancing our ties. We are soon to have a new PM in the UK, which will provide a welcome change in how we engage with India’s re-elected PM Modi,” she said at the time. Patel once again returns as the seniormost British Indian member of the UK cabinet, having been forced to resign in November, 2017 as International Development secretary amid a scandal over allegedly failing to disclose meetings with officials in Israel without informing the UK Foreign Office. She had maintained that it was a private visit and Johnson, then the UK foreign secretary, spoke out to back her. Describing Patel as a “good friend” with whom he worked closely together for Global Britain, he had said it was “quite right that she meets with people and organisations overseas”. But Patel was effectively sacked by May, forcing her to the Parliament backbenches, from where she continued to voice her criticism of May’s Brexit plan. She was among the rebel Tory MPs who consistently voted against the former prime minister’s Withdrawal Agreement with the EU as a “bad deal for Britain”, which ultimately sealed May’s term at the top post."

While finance secretary Subhash Chandra Garg was appointed as the power secretary, disinvestment secretary Atanu Chakraborty, a 1985 batch Gujarat cadre IAS officer, will replace Garg as the economic affairs secretary in the finance ministry. Garg is believed to be behind the budget proposal for overseas sovereign borrowing, which has faced severe criticism from several experts, including former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governors. Garg was also at a loggerheads with the Bimal Jalan committee, set up to decide RBI’s economic capital framework, and had submitted a dissent note to the committee. Garg, a 1983 batch IAS officer of the Rajasthan cadre, will take over his responsibilities at the critical infrastructure ministry amid a crisis faced by distribution companies due to their poor financial health, leading to delays in payments to power generation utilities. Garg also assumes office at a time when a new power sector package is in the offing, comprising a new tariff policy and structural reforms. The power sector is reeling under bad loans worth about ₹1 trillion, with around 66 gigawatts (GW) facing various degrees of financial stress. Anil Kumar Khachi, a 1986 batch Himachal Pradesh IAS officer, will move from his home posting to take over as the disinvestment secretary in the department of investment and public asset management. The wide-ranging changes in the apex bureaucratic framework comes at a time when the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, in its second term, has set an ambitious task of making India a $5 trillion economy by 2025. The appointments committee of the cabinet headed by the Prime Minister finalized the postings on Wednesday. Posts of another 12 bureaucrats have been upgraded to the level of special secretary in rank, and pay of secretary. Power secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla has been made the officer on special duty in the home ministry with immediate effect. He will take over from Rajiv Gauba as the home secretary, when he retires on 31 August. Bhalla, who will report directly to home minister Amit Shah, takes over at a critical time, with Shah set to rejig the ministry’s dealings in conflict areas, including Jammu and Kashmir, and Naxal-hit Chhattisgarh. Bhalla will have a fixed two-year tenure as home secretary. Bhalla and his team had put in place a successful template for the allocation of natural resources that is used as a primer for the allotment of other natural resources. The cheerful, straight-talking Bhalla has been an integral part of the NDA government’s plan to supply round-the-clock power to all. Airports Authority of India chairman Guruprasad Mohapatra will become the new secretary of the department for promotion of industry and internal trade. Mohapatra, a 1986 batch Gujarat cadre IAS officer, had earlier served as a joint secretary in the department of commerce. Anshu Prakash, who is currently serving as an additional secretary in the department of telecommunications, has been promoted as the DoT secretary, while Ravi Capoor from the Assam-Meghalaya cadre will become the textiles secretary. P.D. Vaghela, currently serving his home cadre in Gujarat, will be the secretary in the ministry of chemicals and fertilizers, while Anuradha Mitra, the member finance in the ministry of communications, will take over as the secretary, department of official language."
Krishna Veera Vanamali,India may launch $10-billion global bond sale in October,"India is reportedly considering an option to raise $10 billion in one go from its first overseas bond sale in October. The government would prefer to sell yen or euro-denominated debt so as to offer lower yields, reports added. Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan recently warned that India's plan to issue bonds overseas has enormous risks but no real benefit.",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/govt-may-launch-10-billion-global-bond-sale-in-october-1563971300274.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"India’s maiden overseas bond sale couldn’t have come at a better time with yields tumbling globally. The country is considering an option to raise $10 billion in one go from its first overseas bond sale as early as October, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The issuance of sovereign notes by Asia’s third-biggest economy is expected to price at a yield premium of about 90 basis points to 130 points over US Treasuries, according to a Bloomberg survey of foreign and local investors. That’s in line with sales by countries with similar credit ratings such as Indonesia. The novelty of a debut offering may also support demand for India’s debt, analysts say. India’s overall budget deficit is one of the highest in Asia, but that may not deter bond buyers desperate for extra returns at a time when about $13 trillion of global fixed-income assets, or around a quarter of the total, have negative yields. The deal will give global funds more access to Indian sovereign bonds, and may also let the country’s other issuers adjust debt sale prices based on the offshore sovereign bond as a benchmark. “We think an Indian sovereign Eurobond issue would be very well received in today’s markets,"" said Gregory Smith, fixed-income strategist at Renaissance Capital in London. “With US 10-year Treasuries yielding close to 2%, the search for yield continues, plus foreign investors would be looking to realize long-sought-after exposure to the Indian economy."" India’s debt sale would follow a slew of sovereign issuance by emerging market countries this year. Indonesia sold 3.4% bonds due 2029 at 130.50 basis points over Treasuries in June, while the Philippines issued 10-year notes at 110 basis points in January. Russia sold 2029 dollar bonds at a 3.95% yield, and Saudi Arabia issued 2 billion euros of bonds due in 2039 at 140 basis points over mid-swaps. “The very low and even negative yields in developed markets are indirectly positive for EM bonds,"" and that’s likely to result in strong demand for India’s sovereign offering, said Jan Dehn, the London-based head of research at Ashmore Group Plc. India “continues to place barriers to foreign investors in the domestic bond market, so dollar bonds are a second-best way to express a view,"" he said. The South Asian nation’s regulators have capped holdings of sovereign debt by overseas investors, who are allowed to own only about 6% of total outstanding bonds, while peers like Indonesia and South Korea have no restrictions. The announcement of the foreign-bond sale by the country’s finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the 5 July budget helped boost onshore sovereign notes as investors cheered the opening of a new avenue for the country to raise funds. The yield on benchmark 10-year bonds declined to the lowest in 2 1/2 years before paring some gains to trade at 6.46% on Wednesday. But the proposed issuance has also come under scrutiny, with former central bankers and some independent economists criticizing the move, saying India’s general budget deficit and a wider current-account deficit could make the nation vulnerable during episodes of global swings. The combined budget deficit of federal and state governments and state-run firms is about 8% of the gross domestic product. While the gap and growing stresses in the banking system are an area of concern, BNP Paribas Asset Management says Indian assets may still see good demand. “Sentiment has been improving lately, and, India credit metrics are overall good and improving. So the issuance should attract interest from all institutional investors,"" said Jean-Charles Sambor, London-based deputy head of emerging-market fixed income at BNP Paribas Asset Management."

It also didn't have ""specific policies or procedures"" in effect to make accurate disclosures in light of the results of the investigation.As with the FTC fine, Facebook didn't have to admit guilt, though it also didn't deny the allegations. The deal also permanently enjoins the company from violating relevant sections of the Securities Act and Securities Exchange Act.An SEC penalty wasn't expected to be the focus -- numerous leaks had concentrated on the FTC's actions.

WeWork is also looking to raise $5 billion to $6 billion through a bond offering before the IPO, the source added, requesting anonymity because the matter is private. This is more than it had previously been looking to raise. The debt offering could provide comfort to those investing in the IPO who might be concerned that the cash burn at WeWork is so great it will need to raise more money after the initial offering, which would dilute their shareholdings. “That’s a very known psychology by underwriters and IPO investors, and (that fear), that’s something people try to guard against,” said Adam Troso, head of real estate corporate advisory at Greenhill & Co in New York.

Kanishka Pandey,26 million-year-old species of vine snake found in Western Ghats,"Researchers have discovered a new vine snake species, believed to have evolved around 26 million years ago, in the southern Western Ghats. The species, 'Proahaetulla antiqua', was first discovered in 2011 and looked similar to 'Ahaetulla dispar', a small-sized vine snake with similar morphological characters. The new species faces no major extinction threats at the moment, researchers revealed.",https://researchmatters.in/news/researchers-discover-new-species-vine-snake-western-ghats-dates-back-26-million-years?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Tracing history is a tedious task. We decipher millions of clues along the way before getting to what we seek. Sometimes, nature is benevolent and throws up an entire book of history right in front—a history of not just a few centuries, but of millions of years! That's what happened when a group of herpetologists bumped into a vine snake, which they now call Proahaetulla antiqua. ""In 2011, we came across a vine snake in the Agasthyamalai hills that looked very similar to Ahaetulla dispar, a small-sized vine snake in the region with similar morphological characters.  We immediately recognised it as a new species of vine snake but did not realise that it was as deeply divergent as it turned out to be,"" explains Dr A.K. Mallik from IISc, who is the lead author of the study. The team of researchers, from the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru were attempting to study and classify snakes in the Western Ghats systematically. That's when they came across Proahaetulla antiqua, which is endemic to the southern Western Ghats. What's more interesting is that it is an ancient species, thought to have evolved around 26 million years ago during the mid-Oligocene. “We carried out extensive field visits across India to collect morphological data, tissue samples and specimens to understand the patterns of distribution and diversification of vine snake species”, says Dr Mallik. In a study published in the journal PLOS ONE in collaboration with researchers from Chennai Snake Park, Chennai and Bombay Natural History Society, Mumbai, the team has described the unique features of this snake. The study was funded by the Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, DBT-IISc Partnership Programme and the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund. Vine snakes get their names because of their slender bodies and vine-like appearances. While there are similar species in Africa and South America, the Asian vine snakes, distributed throughout Asia, belong to the genus Ahaetulla. In India, there are four species of commonly distributed vine snakes, and another one was discovered in Odisha recently. When the researchers studied the evolutionary tree of Proahaetulla antiqua, they discovered that this species had diverged from the other vine snakes about 26 million years ago. Thus, they are not only a new species but also belong to a new genus. They are named after the Latin words 'antiqua', meaning 'old or ancient'. The common name suggested for these individuals is 'keeled vine snake'. ""In addition to its high genetic divergence, the new genus, Proahaetulla, is different morphologically from closely related species. There are differences in the post-ocular scales have serrated keels on dorsal scales, a higher number of maxillary teeth, dorsal scales, ventral shields and subcaudal shields. They are also longer than others vine snakes, which are distributed sympatrically in the Western Ghats"" says Dr Mallik about the appearance of the new species. The researchers have described the new species from two individuals found in the protected habitats of the Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in Tamil Nadu and the Shendurney Wildlife Sanctuary in Kerala, both located in the southern Western Ghats. ""Both individuals were found in protected areas, and this species is likely to be restricted to a small range in the southern Western Ghats"", says Dr Mallik. The discovery not only helps us know more about the evolution of vine snakes but also the evolutionary history of the Western Ghats, a landmass older than the Himalayas. In India, the field of herpetology is evolving and we are now beginning to decipher the diversity and evolutionary history of reptiles like snakes found here. Although the Western Ghats has been one of the most explored landscapes since the colonial era, how is it that such an ancient species went unnoticed until now? “One possible reason might be the lack of interest in taxonomic studies in general. Systematic studies need large-scale field surveys and financial support, which are lacking. Secondly, as Proahaetulla is superficially similar to Ahaetulla dispar (Gunther's vine snake), it is possible that most individuals encountered by others were misidentified as A. dispar,” shares Dr Mallik. The discovery of an ancient species like Proahaetulla antiqua brings to light the diversity lurking in the country.""There are many more species waiting to be discovered before going extinct due to development"", says Dr Mallik.The good news is that the new species faces no major threats at the moment.Highly misinterpreted and misunderstood, snakes are both worshipped and threatened across India.""Many snakes play a vital role in the ecology of the region where they are found. Snakes are important predators, and often keep prey populations such as rodents under control. Hence, there needs to be more awareness about the importance of snakes in ecosystems, and their benefits to us,"" signs off Dr Mallik."

Anmol Sharma,"England once used 4 wicketkeepers in a Test, no one took a catch","During a Test against New Zealand from July 24-29, 1986, England fielded four different wicketkeepers. Designated wicketkeeper Bruce French got injured while batting and got to keep only on the fourth day for one ball. Bill Athey, Bobby Parks and retired cricketer Bob Taylor, who was doing PR work at the stadium, also kept but no one registered a catch.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/four-wicket-keepers-in-a-single-test-29275?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"On July 25, 1986, England fielded four wicketkeepers at various times, owing to an injury to the original man Bruce French. Two of the substitutes included Bob Taylor — the legend who was already two years into his retirement and Bobby Parks — the Hampshire cricketer who never donned a Test cap again. Karthik Parimalrevisits the Test that will be remembered for this unique statistic. Having retired from international cricket two years ago, Bob Taylor was savouring the sight of the English players carve up a New Zealand attack that, apart from Richard Hadlee, looked frail and ready to disintegrate. On the first day, from the fine confines of a stand at the majestic Lord’s, he saw Martyn Moxon and David Gower score a stoic 74 and 62 respectively, while simultaneously performing his duties as a host for the match’s sponsor Cornhill. The next morning, he applauded Hadlee’s 26th five-wicket haul when the latter had Phil Edmonds caught by Martin Crowe in the slip cordon. At 258 for 6, England were in a fix when Bruce French, the wicketkeeper, walked out to consolidate. In his 12th delivery, he turned away from a Hadlee bouncer that eventually struck him on the back of the helmet. He collapsed on the floor and it had immediately become evident that the blow wasn’t a mild one. When the helmet came off, blood trickled out from the cut and it was later made known that three stitches were required to cover the wound up. England’s innings resumed, Hadlee picked up his sixth wicket, and the final total on the board was 307. The Kiwis had staged a fine comeback, although Wisden rightly noted that “two different games were taking place — one when Hadlee was bowling and the other when he was out of the attack.” When New Zealand’s first innings commenced, French was in no shape to take the field. In fact, his participation in the rest of the first Cornhill Test was under a shadow. One expected Bobby Parks, the Hampshire cricketer, to don the ’keeper’s gloves, but he was not the first name that popped into the management’s heads. Instead, the less proficient Bill Athey took his place behind the stumps, but it was only for 2 overs. A frantic search for Taylor, England’s retired wicketkeeper, was on in the meanwhile. Having convinced him that he was the man for the moment, England then asked for New Zealand skipper Jeremy Coney’s consent to make the switch, and the latter duly obliged. So, at 45, Taylor came out of his retirement to keep wickets for his country one last time. Although he had to borrow a kit, his wicketkeeping gloves were, incredibly, in his car. Although no catches or stumping opportunities came his way, Taylor was undoubtedly flawless behind the stumps. Not once there was a hint of untidiness in the way he collected each delivery. The English camp would have preferred he carried on, but the right thing was eventually done as Parks was called upon to take over from where Taylor had left. In all, four wicketkeepers were used during the course of the innings, the first such instance in the history of cricket, and one that is yet to be repeated. Despite all the commotion behind the wickets, New Zealand trudged along nicely, riding on Crowe’s century and Bruce Edgar’s 83. For England, Graham Dilley and Edmonds were amongst the scalps, but none of them could be attributed to the ‘keeper for he had received no opportunity to effect a dismissal. He worked the whole of the third day and, on the fourth morning, French resumed, but for just one ball, since Dilley took his fourth wicket to pull the curtains on New Zealand’s innings at 342. In their second outing, England galloped to 295 for 6 and the innings was declared when French was the next batsman in. Gooch amassed 183, a knock that took over seven hours to etch and seized away the Man-of-the-Match award from Hadlee. In reply, New Zealand batted for 15 overs and stumps were called when the scorecard read 41 for 2. The target was 261 and, due to lack of time, the match duly ended in a turgid draw."
Kanishka Pandey,"WhatsApp Pay to roll out this year, confirms Global Head","Facebook-owned WhatsApp's payments service WhatsApp Pay will be rolling out later this year, the platform's Global Head Will Cathcart confirmed. Facebook has been beta-testing the payments service in India with about 10 lakh users, the full roll-out of which was stuck over regulatory issues. The RBI had said it didn't comply with the data localisation norms of India.",https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/whatsapp-payments-confirmed-to-roll-out-this-year-in-india-to-counter-google-pay-paytm/1655913/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"WhatsApp, which has over 400 million users of its messaging service in India, plans to roll out its much-awaited payments service in the country later this year, more than a year after it began testing the offering here. The Facebook-owned company has been testing its payments service in the country since last year with about a million users, but could not launch full-fledged services as it has been awaiting regulatory approvals. Speaking at an event here on Thursday, WhatsApp Global Head Will Cathcart said the company’s vision is to make sending money as easy as sending messages on the platform. “We built payments based on the UPI standard, partnered with banks here in India… We believe that if we did this right, it will accelerate financial inclusion and bring more people in India’s fast-growing digital economy. We can’t wait to provide the service to more of our users all across India later this year,” he said. Cathcart, however, did not clarify whether the company has received a go-ahead from the regulator and policy makers on the planned launch. WhatsApp’s service, which would compete against the likes of Paytm, PhonePe and GooglePay, is yet to be rolled out nationally in India. The company, which has over 1.5 billion users globally, is looking at rolling out payments service in other markets as well. WhatsApp’s ambitious payment services’ blueprint in India has been caught in a bind over concerns around authentication and its data storage practices. In the past, its home-grown rivals have alleged that WhatsApp’s payment platform has security risks for consumers and is not in compliance with the guidelines. In October last year, WhatsApp had said it had developed a system to store payments-related data in India as part of compliance with the regulator Reserve Bank of India’s policy on storing such data locally. In May this year, WhatsApp had told the Supreme Court that its trial run was likely to be completed by July, and that it will not launch payments services in India without fully complying with the central bank norms. RBI, last month, had clarified that all data related to payments, including those processed abroad, must be stored only in India. Also, in case the payment processing is done abroad, the data should be deleted from the systems there and brought back to India within 24 hours, it had stated. Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, during his address at the event, said “…400 million Indians are using WhatsApp, out of the base of 1.5 billion” and that he expects the local number to rise to a billion-plus in the next three years. In 2017, the company had said its India user base was at over 200 million. However, it hasn’t provided an official update to that number since then. “And I can assure you in the next three years, it will be a billion plus from India,” he said. WhatsApp is partnering with the Women Transforming India (WTI) Awards 2019, flagship initiative of Niti Aayog and will provide support amounting to USD 100,000 for the WTI winners. The WTI Awards, which Niti Aayog organises in partnership with the United Nations, recognises stories of exceptional achievements by women who are breaking the glass ceiling and challenging stereotypes through businesses, enterprises, and initiatives aimed at solving key societal challenges. “Small businesses are the backbone of a strong economy and I am proud of the role WhatsApp can play in helping build the next generation of India’s women entrepreneurs,” Cathcart said, pointing out the importance of investing in building digital skills.
He said the company will pilot enhanced WhatsApp training modules with startups.

The ship's captain said that ""everyone was safe with good cooperation with the Iranian personnel onboard"", Stena Bulk said in a statement. Other crew members aboard the tanker are from Russia, Latvia and the Philippines.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swedish-owner-of-oil-tanker-seized-by-iran-says-crew-safe/story-UkW8TLNSWZHmLEjOISSU7J.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"The Swedish company that owns the UK-flagged oil tanker seized by Iran said Wednesday it had finally been able to contact its crew being held on board and they declared themselves “safe”. Stena Bulk said in a statement that the ship’s captain “advised that everyone was safe with good cooperation with the Iranian personnel onboard”. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seized control of the Stena Impero tanker last Friday as it was navigating through an international passage in the middle of the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow chokepoint at the entrance of the Gulf. Iranian officials have given varying reasons for its seizure and continued detention. Some, such as Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, said it was for breaching maritime regulations. It has also been variously claimed that its transponder was turned off, it was going the wrong way along a shipping channel or had collided with an unidentified fishing vessel. Others, such as parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani, said it was a tit-for-tat move responding to British commandos seizing an Iranian oil tanker on July 4 as it passed through Gibraltar’s waters, under suspicion it was breaking EU sanctions on oil deliveries to Syria. Iran has hinted it was open to a tanker swap, releasing the Stena Impero in exchange for its tanker, Grace 1, being allowed on its way. Stena Bulk has been trying for days to have its representatives visit the Stena Impero and see the 23 detained crew members -- who hail from India, Russia, Latvia and the Philippines -- to verify their wellbeing and press for their release. On Tuesday it insisted in a statement that the vessel was “in compliance with maritime regulations” when it was seized, with transponders functioning and using the right shipping traffic passage. “We can confirm that we are not aware of, and nor is there any evidence of a collision involving the Stena Impero,” it said. While its representatives have not been able to physically see the crew, Stena Bulk said in its statement Wednesday that it had had “direct communication” with the ship’s captain since late Tuesday. The CEO of Stena Bulk, Erik Hanell, said the company appreciated the ability to speak to the crew remotely and expressed hope “that this is a first sign that we will soon see more positive progress from the Iranian authorities”. Britain has slammed the seizure of the Stena Impero as “state piracy” that threatened freedom of navigation in the Strait of Hormuz. It has called for a European naval mission to be set up in the Gulf, separate from US patrols, to ensure the safety of shipping there. France has expressed willingness to take part in an “observer” mission, with efforts being made to de-escalate the situation. The ship has since been held off shore near Iran’s southern port of Bandar Abbas."
Apaar Sharma,"Not religion, Triple Talaq Bill about justice and dignity: RS Prasad","Speaking on the Triple Talaq Bill in the Lok Sabha on Thursday, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the bill is not about religion, but about women justice and dignity. Prasad said despite the Supreme Court verdict striking down the practice of instant Triple Talaq in August 2017, women are still being divorced by 'talaq-e-biddat'.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/must-for-gender-equality-justice-govt-on-triple-talaq-bill-in-lok-sabha/story-5p5ysXsydxFqitnQ1MEJoI.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Lok Sabha on Thursday took up for consideration the contentious bill to make the practice of instant triple talaq illegal with up to three years in jail for the husband.Moving the bill for consideration, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the legislation was a must for gender equality and justice as despite an August 2017 Supreme Court verdict striking down the practice of instant triple talaq , women were being divorced by ‘talaq-e-biddat’.He said, since January 2017, 574 such cases had been reported by the media.The ban on ‘triple talaq’ has been enforced through three ordinances issued by Narendra Modi government as the related bill couldn’t be passed by the previous Lok Sabha.A fresh bill was introduced by the new government in June during the ongoing Parliament session.Under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, divorcing through instant triple talaq will be illegal, void and would attract a jail term of three years for the erring husband.Prasad said to allay fears that the proposed law could be misused, the government had included certain safeguards such as provision of bail for the accused before trial.While the bill makes triple talaq a “non-bailable” offence, an accused can approach a magistrate even before trial to seek bail. A provision has been added to allow the magistrate to grant bail “after hearing the wife”, the minister said.The Opposition termed the penal provision for the Muslim husband ‘discriminatory’ and also objected to the 3-year jail term for the practitioner of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ as disproportionate and counter-productive. Those opposing the Bill said it was ‘discriminatory’ as it sought to target only Muslim women even when the problem of abandoning-wives was not unique to the community.Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi said the majority enjoyed by the NDA government doesn’t mean that Parliamentary committees--where such contentions Bills should be debated--are bypassed. He demanded a comprehensive Bill to empower women from all religions and sections. Trinamool Congress MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay drove the above point home by expressing his party’s opposition to the practice of ‘triple talaq’ yet requesting the Centre to drop the 3-year jail term which he called “arbitrary and excessive.” “We support Muslim women who have a problem with ‘triple talaq’. But the Bill is excessive, arbitrary as a jailed husband can’t support his family or give maintenance to his separated wife,” the TMC MP said while demanding that the Bill be referred to a joint select committee. Minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the argument against 3-year jail term was specious and mischievous as it sought to side with the guilty. “Those who do not refrain from ‘triple talaq’ deserve to be jailed,” he said. “All the major Islamic countries had banned “triple talaq” and therefore it couldn’t be argued that there was even a religious ground for opposing it,” he added.  NDA ally JD(U)’s MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh declared that his party will abstain from voting on the “triple talaq” Bill as it was fundamentally opposed to any interference on this matter and added that the Bill was likely to create mistrust within the Muslim community. “The government should instead try to awaken the community to women’s rights,” he said, adding that despite being a part of the NDA, his party had a long standing policy of divergence on controversial issues including common civil code and article 370.Opposing the BIll, AIMIM chief Osaduddin Owaisi said its real purpose was to drive a wedge between the Muslim community and its religion. “The BJP should fly all its women MPs in a special plane to the Sabarimala shrine in Kerala if it really wanted to empower women,” he said before closing his speech."

Its other existing investors such as Nexus Venture Partners and Blume Ventures had also participated in the round. Surajit Basu, Vice President, Country Manager India at Sapiens International, had earlier told Inc42, “With a massive and almost entirely uninsured population, India is a promising dark horse on the insurtech horizon. But while initial market penetration may have been slow, insurtech revenues are on the rise and expected to hit over 1.1 Mn in the next year. India, with its large IT market and tech expertise, stands to benefit from advancements in insurtech but lacks a strong base on which to build.” According to the IBEF, insurance penetration in India is as low as 4%. The central government had increased the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) limit in the insurance sector from 26% to 49% under the automatic route, which will further help attract investments in the sector."

Playing for Toronto Nationals in the opening game of the Global T20 Canada tournament, Yuvraj could only get 14 runs in 27 balls before he was stumped out in Rizwan Cheema’s over. He stepped up on the swinging delivery, got an edge and the keeper dropped it on to the stumps. Yuvraj was still in the crease as per the replays, but the batsman had already walked off the field before the replays were checked as the square leg umpire had raised his finger.
In the match, Vancouver Knights won the toss and elected to field. Yuvraj came on to strike after the dismissal of Callum McLeod for 17, who was dismissed by Saad Bin Zafar. This incident occurred in the 17th over, by the end of which Knights had reached 119/4.
Chasing 160, Knights lost their openers with just 36 runs on the board. Chris Gayle (12) and Tobias Visee (20) were sent back to the pavilion by Mark Montfort and Jeremy Gordon, respectively. Chadwick Bolton and Rassie van der Dussen stitched together a match-winning partnership and the duo mixed caution with aggression to take Knights safely over the line by eight wickets and 16 balls to spare.
Bolton and van der Dussen had put up an unbeaten stand of 126 runs, which saw both batsmen bringing up their respective fifties. Bolton and van der Dussen remained unbeaten on 59 and 65, respectively.

Apart from Yuvraj, several international stars such as Brendon McCullum, Chris Gayle, Heinrich Klaasen, etc also were included in the playing XI of the two teams.

Anmol Sharma,Change in Team India coach may affect team: BCCI official,"A BCCI official has said that Team India head coach Ravi Shastri and captain Virat Kohli complement each other well and it would be unfair to change half of a team that has been successful.

Shastri took over the reins as head coach of Team India after Anil Kumble’s infamous departure in 2017. Kumble’s working style and his methods were not liked by skipper Kohli which ended the partnership pre-maturely. Since then, Shastri took the command of the proceedings and helped the team in attaining the numero uno spot in Tests. He also shares a good rapport with most of the players and known for his man-management skills.
A senior BCCI official said that it was important to continue with Shastri and Kohli as the two heads in the process of transition as the team looks to back youngsters with an eye on the 2020 World T20 as well as the 2023 ODI World Cup.
“Nothing permanent with a long term effect should happen at this stage of transition. Shastri and Kohli complement each other well and it would be unfair to change half of a team that has been successful,” the BCCI official was quoted by IANS.
The official added that it was important to maintain continuity as a change in coach could mean that the players would have to adapt to his ways from the beginning and the equation that already exists in the Indian dressing room would go for a toss.
“A change in coach may prove to disturb the equation that exists which allows the players to have the mental space to excel. If a change is made at this stage, then it would be a change of strategy and planning for the next 5 years. It would be unfair to take such a decision at a stage when the stakeholders are not the ones deciding,” the official explained.
The BCCI invited applications for the positions of head coach, batting coach, bowling coach, fielding coach, physio, strength and conditioning coach and administrative manager for the Indian team on July 16. Shastri and his team will get an automatic entry into the recruitment process.
The current coaching staff were handed a 45-day extension after their tenure ended with the World Cup. But assistant coach Sanjay Bangar is under the scanner after India’s exit in the World Cup and the inability to find a number four batsman over the last two seasons.

A day after 49 prominent citizens wrote to Prime Minister over the incidents of hate crimes in the country, a Kerala BJP leader has hit out at filmmaker Adoor Gopalakrishnan, one of the signatories on the letter, and has asked him to ‘change his name and go to another planet’ if he cannot bear to hear the Jai Shri Ram chant. 
Adoor is one of the 49 artists who expressed their concern over the lynching of Muslims, Dalits and other minorities, increasing religious identity-based hate crimes and the growing intolerance towards dissent in the country.  The letteralso said that the religious chant ""Jai Shri Ram"" has become a “provocative war cry,” and the artists asked the Prime Minister to put a stop to the name of Ram being ""defiled in this manner.”
BJP Kerala spokesperson Advocate B Gopalakrishnan hit out at the filmmaker on Facebook, stating, ""Jai Shri Ram will always be chanted in India as well in the neighbouring countries. One who doesn't want to hear that can get his or her name registered at Sriharikota and go to the moon or some other planet. People of India have voted to chant Jai Shri Ram… they will keep on chanting it and will even chant it in front of Adoor's house if needed... that is a democratic right... where would it be chanted if not in India?""
The BJP leader in his Facebook post also accused the filmmaker of remaining silent on other issues and speaking up selectively.
""Sir you are a respectful filmmaker... but you shouldn't condemn the culture of the state. where were you when Mamta Banerjee jailed Hindus for chanting Jai Shri Ram.. when Pinarayi Vijayan booked people for chanting Saranam.. when students stabbed their batchmate – you did not react on any of these occasions, were you on a vow of silence then?"" the leader’s post said.
""I know why you have responded now for you didn’t get what you wanted.. you didn’t get what you wanted from the union government or you want the government to give you something - with the utmost contempt,” the leader said in his post.
Meanwhile, in response, Adoor stated that he will continue to object to the use of the chant Jai Shri Ram as a call to kill people. 
“I won’t succumb to anyone’s threat on this subject. Using the name of Shri Ram for the call to kill is against the believers. Let the state decide if people like me should go to the moon or any other planet,” he said.
Meanwhile, the youth wing of the CPI(M), the DYFI state committee, has come out in support of Adoor.
“Such RSS threatening won’t work here in Kerala. The provoking kind of words of the BJP leader is an insult to the state. Adoor is a figure honoured by the whole world. Adoor and any other person have the liberty to express their opinion and will continue to do so. The BJP shouldn’t try to kill freedom of opinion by threatening. We declare absolute support to Adoor. It has always been the strategy of the RSS to silence voices by luring or by threatening. Kerala is strong enough to survive such heinous attempts,” the statement says.
Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee President Mullappally Ramachandran has also spoken out in support of Adoor and stated that threats against Adoor are highly condemnable.
""Cultural figures in the country have spoken out at a time when incidents of atrocities continue to take place even after the Modi government came to power for a second term. Will the BJP send them all to the moon?"" he asked.

Apaar Sharma,SC orders cinema halls to play clips on prevention of child abuse,The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered cinema halls across the country to screen clips on prevention of child abuse and prosecution of crimes against children. The court asked the Ministry of Women and Child Development to ensure suitable clips are screened. The apex court also ordered TV channels to show these clips along with child helpline numbers.,https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/pocso-case-sc-orders-setting-up-of-centrally-funded-special-courts-in-each-districts/1656567/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"The Supreme Court on Thursday directed setting up of a centrally-funded designated court in each district having more than 100 FIRs under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act to deal exclusively with cases of sexual offences against children.

“We would expect our above stated directions to be implemented and exclusively designated courts to try offences under the POCSO Act, in terms of the above directions, to start functioning within 60 days from the date of the present order,” a bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said, while asking the Centre and states to implement its direction.

In a slew of directions, the apex court also said that a short clip, intended to spread awareness about prevention of child abuse and prosecution of crimes against children, be screened in every movie hall and transmitted by various television channels at regular intervals.

The top court directed that the special court be funded by the Centre and take care of appointment of presiding officer, support persons, special public prosecutors, court staff and infrastructure, including creation of child-friendly environment and vulnerable witness court rooms.

The court, which has on its own taken up the issue of alarming rise in the number of rape cases against children, took note of a report which said that one of the major causes of hinderance in completing timely trial of
POCSO cases was delay in receiving reports from forensic science laboratory (FSL).

The top court perused the report prepared by senior advocate V Giri, assisting it as an amicus curiae in the case, and said the suggestion that there should be designated FSL in every district of the country for the purposes of POCSO Act can be considered at a later stage.

“For the present, we direct the directors of the state forensic science laboratories and the concerned authority in the state government to ensure that the existing and available forensic science laboratories in each state will function in an effective manner insofar as analysis etc of the samples collected under the POCSO Act are concerned and reports of such analysis be sent promptly and without any delay,” the bench, also comprising Justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose, said.

The bench directed the chief secretaries of all the states and union territories to ensure that its direction is complied with “forthwith”.

“In each district of the country, if there are more than 100 cases under the POCSO Act, an exclusive/designated special court will be set up, which will try no other offence except those under the POCSO Act,” the bench said.

“Such courts will be set up under a central scheme and will be funded by the central government, which fund will not only take care of the appointment of the presiding officer, but also the appointments of support persons, special public prosecutors, court staff and infrastructure, including creation of child-friendly environment and vulnerable witness court rooms, etc,” it said.

The apex court said that while drawing up the panel of support persons in each district, which should not exceed a reasonable number keeping in mind the total number of cases, care should be taken to appoint people who are dedicated to the cause.

It said that apart from academic qualifications, such people should be oriented towards child rights and sensitive to the needs of a child and otherwise be child-friendly.

“The same standards would also apply in the matter of appointment of special public prosecutors,” it said.

The bench accepted the suggestion of the amicus regarding screening of short clips in movie halls and directed the Ministry of Women and Child Development to implement it through its agencies.

The bench noted the submission of the amicus who said, “A short clip intended to spread an awareness of the subject in general, namely, prevention of child abuse and prosecution of crimes against children, should necessarily be screened in every movie hall and could also be transmitted by various television channels at regular intervals.”

“A child helpline number should also be displayed not only in such clip but also at various other prominent places, in schools and other public places,” the amicus said.

The bench passed the order after perusing the reports filed by the amicus and apex court registrar Surinder S Rathi, who was entrusted with the work of collating and collecting data regarding number of POCSO cases.

“Both the reports contain several suggestions in respect of the core of the issue, namely, to ensure timely completion of investigations and consequential trials in the offences under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,” it noted.

“While, both the amicus curiae and Rathi, in their reports, have suggested that further time should be granted for collection of data in terms of the earlier order of this court, we are inclined to take a different view of the matter at this stage,” the bench said.

The bench, which posted the matter for further hearing on September 26, asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to apprise it about the progress made in respect of the implementation of its directions after four weeks."

His family, so far, has received 400 messages and calls leaving him worried that the fake news could reach his ailing mother. Though the Dahisar Police have taken a written complaint from him, Dusange claims that the cops were not taking his case very seriously as the messages were still being circulated across groups. 

The media professional, who is having a hard time convincing his well-wishers that he is alive and kicking, suspects the hand of an acquaintance behind this incident. Dusange has even told the police about it. ""I tried calling the suspect but he hung up,"" he said. 
Experts say that earlier such cases could have been tried under section 66A of the IT Act which has now been struck down by the Supreme Court.

Nandini Sinha,Ukraine seizes Russian tanker that blocked its ships last year,Ukraine's security service has seized a Russian tanker that allegedly blocked its ships in the Kerch Strait last year. Russia had allegedly used the tanker to block three Ukrainian naval vessels before detaining them and 24 Ukrainian sailors. Ukraine said the Russian tanker was previously called 'Neyma' and its owners had changed its name to 'Nika Spirit' to avoid detection.,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/25/ukraine-seizes-russian-tanker-on-danube-port-city-of-izmail-nika-spirit?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Ukrainian authorities have seized a Russian tanker moored in a river port near the Black Sea in apparent retaliation for Russia’s seizure of three Ukrainian vessels and arrest of 24 sailors in November last year.
Ukraine’s SBU security service said in a Facebook post on Thursday it had seized the Russian tanker Nika Spirit in Izmail, a port on the Danube River near the country’s border with Romania.
The SBU said it had seized documents from the ship and questioned its crew. It also released a video showing its officers and those from the military prosecutor’s office boarding the vessel.
The Russian foreign ministry threatened a swift retaliation if arrests were made, but later a spokesman for the Russian embassy in Kyiv told news agencies that while the vessel remained impounded, the crew were on their way back to Russia.
Earlier, the Russian agency Interfax, citing an unnamed source, said there were about 15 sailors onboard the ship, all believed to be Russian citizens. Ukrainian prosecutors said about 10 crew members had been questioned.
The SBU said the vessel had previously been called Neyma and had taken part in blocking the three Ukrainian ships in the Kerch strait last year, with the owners apparently changing its name to Nika Spirit to avoid detection.
Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and has built a bridge over the Kerch strait, which separates the peninsula from Russia. Ukrainian ships have to pass through the strait to exit the Sea of Azov. The 24 sailors seized during the November incident in the strait have been held in Russian prisons since.
Moscow accused the ships of illegally entering Russian territorial waters, which Kyiv has denied. The Hamburg-based International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea has condemned Moscow over the incident and said it should release the sailors.
The newly elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said bringing the sailors home was a priority, and the move to seize the Russian vessel came after the comedian-turned-president won an overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections over the weekend.
Zelenskiy spoke to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, by telephone for the first time last week and discussed a possible prisoner exchange, and there was a sense that there could be a deal soon involving the 24 sailors. However, a Moscow court ruled that the sailors should stay in custody for a further three months, and Thursday’s move threatens to inflame tensions further.
The head of the Russian parliament’s international affairs committee, Leonid Slutsky, on Thursday branded Ukraine’s move against the Russian tanker “state-sponsored piracy” and said it was “unlawful and illicit pressure on the investigation” into the Ukrainian sailors seized by Russia.

Anmol Sharma,Sandeep Warrier to replace Navdeep Saini for West Indies A Tests,Kerala pacer Sandeep Warrier will replace Navdeep Saini in India A squad which is currently touring West Indies. This comes after Saini was picked for the senior Indian cricket team for the T20I and ODI series against West Indies. Sandeep will fly to West Indies on Friday and will only be available for selection for second and third unofficial Tests.,https://www.crictracker.com/sandeep-warrier-to-replace-navdeep-saini-for-west-indies-a-tests/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Kerala seamer Sandeep Warrier is set to replace Navdeep Saini in India A squad which is currently touring the Caribbeans. Saini, a fast bowler who has impressed with his ability to generate serious pace consistently, was recently picked for the senior team for the T20I and ODI series against the West Indies starting August 3.
However, Warrier will be available only for the second and third unofficial Tests for India ‘A’ as he is flying to the Caribbeans only on Friday. India ‘A’ did well to bowl the West Indies A for only 228 runs in their first innings on the opening day of the first unofficial Test in North Sound on Wednesday and were comfortably placed at 70 for 1 at stumps.
Warrier, 28, was part of the India A team that played two first-class matches and five ODIs against Sri Lanka ‘A’ last month at home. The pacer from Thrissur had made his first-class debut almost seven years ago and has grown in leaps and bounds ever since. Last year, he had a productive outing in the Ranji Trophy, picking 44 wickets in just 10 games.
Warrier’s luck shone in the Indian Premier League last year as well as when he was picked by Kolkata Knight Riders after two of their young pacers Kamlesh Nagarkoti and Shivam Mavi got injured.
“I got the message that I will be replacing Saini in the West Indies squad on Monday. Though I have played for India ‘A’ before, this will be the first time I will be travelling with ‘A’ team abroad. So I am pretty excited and hope to do well in the opportunities I get to play in Windies,” Warrier was quoted by Times of India as saying from Chennai.
Having made his first-class debut in 2012, Warrier has played in 48 first-class games, 44 List ‘A’ matches and 43 T20s so far. He has picked 160 first-class wickets, 51 List ‘A’ and 43 T20 wickets.
Saini got his maiden India call in the limited-over series after the Test call he got last year for the one-off match against Afghanistan at home in the place of Mohammed Shami. Saini though didn’t get to play in that game.

“He did not say with meaning any disrespect to the honourable chairperson. I don’t think an issue is to be made out of this. On the contrary, it may be taken as a complimentary comment for which there should be appreciation,” Memon added. While addressing BJP MP Rama Devi (who was presiding over the session), Khan had stoked a controversy. “Aap mujhe itni achchhi lagti hain ki mera mann karta hai ki aap ki aankhon mein aankhein dale rahoon (I am so fond of you that I always feel like looking into your eyes),” the SP leader told the BJP MP.
Devi was quick to react. She reprimanded Khan and said,“This is not the way to speak, please expunge these remarks,” to which the SP MP said, “You are very respected, you are like my sister.”
Hitting out at Khan, Speaker Om Birla said, “It is very easy for all of you to demand ‘expunge this, expunge that’, but why should the need to expunge arise at all? Once a remark is given, it is already in the public domain. Therefore, we all should speak keeping the dignity of the Parliament in mind.”

This is the Masayoshi Son-led company’s second mega fund.

SoftBank’s board is set to meet Thursday to approve the investment, according to people familiar with the matter.
Now, according to WSJ, SoftBank is looking at an “unlikely coalition of investors”, including Apple, Goldman Sachs, Standard Chartered, and the Kazakhstan government. Apple and chipmaker Qualcomm Corp both invested in SoftBank’s first fund, seeking access to promising new technology companies and customers for their products.

With this $40 billion fund, SoftBank is going to focus completely on technology. Sources told WSJ that even Microsoft could be part of this fund and that SoftBank is in advanced talks with them.

The WSJ reports that the Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi governments are likely to invest again, though Saudi Arabia, it stated, is entering at a lower level than the $45 billion it contributed last time.

SoftBank has been a backer of successful companies world over, funding the likes of Uber, Slack, and WeWork. In India, big-ticket investments include ones in OYO Rooms, OlaCabs, Flipkart, and Paytm, whose valuations received a boost thanks to the SoftBank association.
Flipkart was sold to Walmart for $16 billion and SoftBank almost doubled its returns.

The SoftBank Vision Fund, led by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, was announced in 2016. In 2017, the firm closed $93 billion and later the fund size became $98 billion. The fund focusses on Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotics, Cloud Computing, software, consumer tech and fintech.

Addressing US lawmakers during his trip to the country on Tuesday, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had revealed that his country had 40 different militant groups operating within its borders. “We were fighting the US war on terror. Pakistan has nothing to do with 9/11. Al-Qaeda was in Afghanistan. There were no militant Taliban in Pakistan. But we joined the US war. Unfortunately, when things went wrong, where I blame my government, we did not tell the US exactly the truth on the ground,” he had told lawmakers at the Capitol Hill.
“Part of the reason was, our governments were not in control. There were 40 different militant groups operating within Pakistan,” he had said.

“It has not been an easy decision to make and I have been thinking about this for some time. But with the ICC World Test Championship commencing shortly, and Pakistan boasting some very exciting young fast bowlers, it is appropriate that I call on my time in Test cricket so that the selectors can plan accordingly.

Even as there are speculations over when he will hang his boots from international cricket, Rishabh Pant will be India’s number one wicketkeeper from now onwards. Meanwhile, Dhoni will now be serving his nation, this time as army personnel.
The Jharkhand-born is also a Lieutenant Colonel (Honorary) in the Parachute Regiment of the Territorial Army and is set to be serving his unit from July 31 to August 15. The veteran will be with the unit in the Kashmir Valley as a part of the Victor Force.
He will be staying with the troops and will have the task of patrolling guard and post duty. The same was made clear after a request from the officer and approval from the Army Headquarters. There is also a concern over MS Dhoni’s security as he is a civilian.
However, Army Chief Gen. Bipin Rawat feels that Dhoni doesn’t need security as he is equipped enough to perform his duties. “I don’t think we will need to protect him, he will protect the citizens and garrison entrusted to his task,” the Army Chief was quoted as saying in NDTV.
“When a citizen of India wants to don the military uniform then he has to also be prepared to fulfill the task for which the uniform has been assigned to him. MS Dhoni has carried out his basic training and we know that he will be able to accomplish the task.”
“In fact, he will be protecting a lot of other people because he will now be performing with the 106 Territorial Army battalion (Para). It is a very good battalion and they have been performing line of communication duties, static protection and he will be a part of it,” he added.
Dhoni has taken a two-month break from playing cricket in order to serve his country. In 2015, he became a qualified paratrooper after having completed five parachute training jumps from Indian Army aircraft at the Agra training camp.

SoftBank will invest $38 billion in Vision Fund 2, more than the $28 billion it invested in the first fund. Saudi Arabia, which contributed $45 billion for the first $97 billion fund, was absent from list of investors on Friday.",https://in.reuters.com/article/softbank-group-vision-fund/softbank-groups-108-billion-vision-fund-2-draws-in-microsoft-apple-idINKCN1UL015?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,"SoftBank Group Corp has secured pledges from Microsoft Corp and other investors of around $108 billion for a second Vision Fund aimed at investing in technology firms.
The Japanese conglomerate itself plans to invest $38 billion in the fund, it said in a statement. Others set to join include Apple Inc and Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) - both investors in the first fund.
Notable by their absence on the list of state and corporate backers were the sovereign wealth funds of the two countries which formed the cornerstone of its first fund: Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, as well as investment bank Goldman Sachs.
SoftBank said it was still talking to potential investors and that it expected the fund’s anticipated capital to grow.
Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Bloomberg in October his country was ready to commit a further $45 billion through its Public Investment Fund (PIF), adding: “Without the PIF, there will be no SoftBank Vision Fund”.
Those close links later compelled Softbank founder and Chief Executive Masayoshi Son to defend the relationship after Saudi security personnel were accused of murdering Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist critical of the Saudi state.
Discussions between Softbank and PIF were ongoing, but the Saudis would wait for a formal proposal before deciding whether to invest in the new fund, a source familiar with the matter said.
A spokeswoman for Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala told Reuters it was still in the process of assessing a potential investment. The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday reported Goldman Sachs would invest in the fund.
THE VISION
The second fund’s investor base reflects diversification beyond the Middle East that provided most of the first $100 billion fund’s outside capital as SoftBank touts industry-beating returns, with joiners including cash rich Japanese financial institutions and a Kazakh sovereign wealth fund.
“Those investing two years ago were investing in the vision, there was no proof the concept was going to succeed,” said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Chris Lane.
“Given the track record achieved over the last two years Vision Fund 2 has been substantially de-risked,” Lane said.
SoftBank in May said the first fund had generated a 45% internal rate of return for investors in its common shares, or 29% when debt-like preferred shares are included - though the gains still exist mostly on paper.
On Friday, it said other participants in the second fund will include the National Investment Corporation of National Bank of Kazakhstan, Standard Chartered Bank PLC, undisclosed parties from Taiwan and the fund’s own managers.
The new fund has broad backing from Japan’s financial industry including units of the three mega banks, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc and Mizuho Financial Group Inc, SoftBank’s statement showed.
It said Daiwa Securities Group Inc, Dai-ichi Life Holdings Inc and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc have also signed memoranda of understanding (MOU).
The financial structure of the fund, how much each investor would contribute and whether they would provide debt or equity backing was not disclosed by Softbank.
A spokeswoman for Standard Chartered, however, told Reuters the bank would take part in the fund as a debt investor.
“The objective of the fund is to facilitate the continued acceleration of the AI revolution through investment in market-leading, tech-enabled growth companies,” SoftBank said in its statement.
Masayoshi Son uses artificial intelligence (AI) as a catch-all term to characterise SoftBank’s investment portfolio, which features businesses as varied as ride-hailing and autonomous driving, insurance and healthcare.
SoftBank has not provided concrete details on the kind of investments it is targeting, said a senior executive at one Japanese bank listed as a participant in the new fund.
“The fund itself is of course attractive, but what matters is the overall balance of the portfolio,” the banker said, declining to be identified further.
LATE-STAGE STARTUPS
Friday’s announcement was driven largely by Softbank’s need to alert shareholders to its planned investment in the fund. SoftBank Group’s shares ended the day up 1.1% in a 0.5% weaker Nikkei 225.
The first Vision Fund launched two years ago with $60 billion in backing from the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. It has already burned through much of its capital with investments in over 80 late-stage tech startups.
Bets included Uber Technologies Inc and WeWork parent The We Company in a spending spree that has reshaped the venture capital industry as SoftBank outguns less-capitalised rivals.
“We’ve seen several startups start to beat their rivals and push them out of the market, mainly because - and only after - they receive investment and backing from SoftBank,” said one Hong Kong-based senior investor at a large venture capital firm.
SoftBank did not provide details on how it would fund its $38 billion contribution to the new fund. With the conglomerate not needing to put up all the money at once, proceeds from the first Vision Fund can potentially be recycled, said analyst Dan Baker at Morningstar.
Such a strategy would rely on the first fund continuing to provide blistering returns, as it transitions beyond identifying and investing in promising startups to managing a portfolio of companies that are listed or heading toward public markets.
“We believe this move should create a positive impression in as much as it confirms the substantial interest in the Vision Fund business and fund procurement capabilities,” UBS analyst Kei Takahashi said in a note to clients.

“People of Uttarakhand believe that if “gua mata” is kept near an ailing man, he helps him in recuperation,” said a source seeking anonymity.
""While the medicinal values of cow milk and urine are well known, people in the hills also believe that the cow gives them oxygen,"" said the source.
However, some Uttarakhand BJP leaders believed that it was an attempt to malign CM’s image by ridiculing his statement. They claimed that studies had shown the medicinal properties of cow urine.
Meanwhile, the CM’s statement which is doing rounds on social media platforms has come after Uttarakhand BJP chief and party MP from Nainital, Ajay Bhatt had hit the headlines by claiming in parliament that women can avoid caesarean deliveries by drinking water from Garud Ganga (a river in Bageshwar district of Kumaon).

While the man died, his wife and child survived the fall. His wife later told the police that he had taken credit cards from several banks and accumulated a debt of ₹8 lakh.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/credit-card-debt-man-jumps-to-death-wife-and-daughter-survive-fall/story-bWVNmnyax7OsypQfLWIvQM.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,"A debt-ridden man died and his wife and four-year-old daughter were injured after they jumped from the terrace of their four-storeyed building in east Delhi’s Jagatpuri early Monday, police said.
The 34-year-old man died on the spot while his daughter’s fall was cushioned by a scooter parked outside the building. The girl and his 31-year-old mother are undergoing treatment at GTB Hospital, Meghna Yadav, deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara), said.
The DCP said since the man had jumped with his daughter in his arms, a case of attempt to murder has been registered against him. “He was stressed as he had accumulated credit card debts,” said the officer.
The man lived with his wife and daughter on the ground floor of a four-storey building in Jagatpuri. He worked for a private firm in Gurgaon. His wife is a homemaker.
The woman, who regained consciousness on Wednesday, told the police that her husband had taken credit cards from several banks and accumulated a debt of Rs 8 lakh. “The bank officials had been repeatedly calling and messaging him to return the money, leaving him worried,” she said in her police statement.
They decided to attempt suicide after the family received no financial help from relatives and friends, she said. “My husband had been telling me we would be better dead than the daily tension about the debts,” she said.
The three attempted suicide around 3.30 am on Monday. “He picked up our daughter and went to the terrace. I followed him. He jumped down with our daughter in his arms. I jumped immediately after,” she said.
There were no other eyewitnesses to the incident but the sound of their fall woke up their neighbours who alerted the police and the three were rushed to the hospital.
“The girl survived because she fell on the seat of a scooter parked below. Her mother received serious head injuries but will survive. He was declared brought dead at the hospital,” said another investigator.
“We took the extreme step because we were very disheartened,” the woman told the police.

Several of the suspects arrived at the Guarulhos airport in a black pickup truck with livery resembling Brazil’s federal police, according to security footage seen by Reuters. Four men left the vehicle with their faces covered, at least one of whom had a rifle, and confronted workers at the airport, who then proceeded to fill up the pickup truck with cargo.
A police report said the thieves left with about 750 kg (1,650 lbs) of gold and other precious metals, along with two airport workers taken as hostages, and remained at large.
An airport spokeswoman said no one was hurt during the assault, but did not comment on potential hostages.
The airport is operated by GRU Airport, a consortium that includes Invepar, Airports Company South Africa, and state airport operator Infraero.

Ankush Verma,We will look for other options if US doesn't sell F-35 jets: Turkey,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said the country would turn elsewhere for fighter jets if the US won't sell it the F-35 jets, adding that a US decision to cut Turkey from the programme would not deter it from meeting its needs. The US removed Turkey from the F-35 programme over Turkey's purchase of Russian S-400 missile defence system.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-security-usa/erdogan-says-turkey-to-turn-elsewhere-if-u-s-will-not-sell-f-35s-idUSKCN1UL11H?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,"President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday Turkey would turn elsewhere for fighter jets if the United States will not sell it the F-35 jets, adding that a U.S. decision to cut Ankara from the program would not deter it from meeting its needs.
The United States said last week it was removing NATO ally Turkey from the F-35 program, as long threatened, after Ankara purchased and received delivery of Russian S-400 missile defenses that Washington sees as a threat.
Washington has also threatened sanctions on Turkey, though Ankara has dismissed the warnings. It has instead put its trust in sympathetic comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has said that Turkey was treated “unfairly”.
Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday he does not blame Turkey for buying the Russian air defense system, but did not say when he would decide on imposing sanctions on Turkey for doing business with the Russian military, as required by a 2017 U.S. law.
“We’re looking at the whole Turkey situation,” Trump said. “It’s a tough situation ... I don’t blame Turkey because there are a lot of circumstances.”
Erdogan, speaking publicly about the strained U.S. ties for the first time in 11 days, said he hoped U.S. officials would be “reasonable” on the question of sanctions, adding that Turkey may also reconsider its purchase of advanced Boeing (BA.N) aircraft from the United States.
“Are you not giving us the F-35s? Okay, then excuse us but we will once again have to take measures on that matter as well and we will turn elsewhere,” Erdogan told members of his ruling AK Party.
“Even if we’re not getting F-35s, we are buying 100 advanced Boeing aircrafts, the agreement is signed... At the moment, one of the Boeing planes has arrived and we are making the payments, we are good customers,” he said. “But, if things continue like this, we will have to reconsider this.”
Russia’s Rostec state conglomerate said Russia would be ready to supply its SU-35 jets to Turkey if Ankara requested them. But, Turkish officials said on Thursday there were no talks with Moscow on alternatives to the F-35 jets for now.
Ties between Ankara and Washington have been strained over a host of issues. Turkey has also been infuriated with U.S. support for the Kurdish YPG militia in Syria, a main U.S. ally in the region that Ankara sees as a terrorist organization.
Ankara has warned that it would launch a military operation in northern Syria to wipe out the YPG if it could not agree with Washington on the planned safe zone in the region, saying it had run “out of patience.”
However, Erdogan said on Friday that Turkey is determined to destroy the “terror corridor” east of the Euphrates river in Syria no matter how talks on the safe zone conclude, as Ankara ramped up its threats of an offensive.

Among several other instances of fund diversion and illegitimate use of home buyers' hard-earned money, the Amrapali Group's companies bought gold bars and other forms of gold worth ₹5.88 crore from Noida-based Yashika Diamonds and recorded the transactions as festival expenses, the court order said.
""This does not seem to be a normal business transaction but in the nature of personal expenses. Thus, this amount should be recovered from the management of the company,"" it said.
The Supreme Court on Tuesday granted huge relief to 42,000 beleaguered home buyers of the Amrapali Group, who are waiting for possession of their flats, as it ruled that the pending projects be completed in a time-bound manner.
The order by a bench of Justice Arun Mishra and Justice U.U. Lalit was not limited to only Amrapali Group's home buyers but they specifically mentioned that projects of other real estate companies should also be completed in a time-bound manner and the home buyers shall not be made to run from pillar to post, which ends up in harassment of people who have invested their hard-earned money.
The court also directed the state-run NBCC to complete all the pending projects and hand over the possession to the home buyers and not to recover additional amount from the home buyers.

Australia’s Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) said the precautionary suspension was triggered by initial information that the plane had broken up in flight.
However, it had since received information that there was no evidence of a potential unsafe condition associated with the aircraft, it added.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said CASA had informed it that an inspection of the crashed plane showed it appeared to have been exposed to aerodynamic loads beyond certification levels.
In a statement, Graeme Harris, the director civil aviation in New Zealand, said travelers, operators and pilots of the country’s 21 affected aircraft could now be assured that concerns expressed after the accident had been tackled.
“We will continue to monitor the investigation into the GA8 accident and will take appropriate action should any related safety issues become apparent,” he added.
The single-engine GA8 is made in Australia by Mahindra Aerospace, a unit of India’s Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (MAHM.NS), and 63 of the 228 planes worldwide are registered in Australia, CASA says.
Nine Swedes were killed when a GA8, dubbed the Airvan 8, crashed during a skydiving trip near the city of Umea in northern Sweden on July 14.
The GA8 is typically used for skydiving, tourism, air patrols, medical evacuations and humanitarian missions in remote locations, Mahindra Aerospace says on its website.

Dishant Sharma,Fans sing Les Misérables song for protest at Man City friendly,"Fans in Hong Kong sung 'Do you hear the people sing?', from the musical Les Misérables, while attending the pre-season friendly match between Manchester City and local outfit Kitchee. Fans in the stadium were also heard chanting 'Free Hong Kong', while some held placards and banners that read 'No Extradition'.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/football/free-hong-kong-protest-as-manchester-city-thrash-kitchee-in-friendly/story-nNk7PLGYo65NVRetgfI3vM.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Demonstrators chanted “Free Hong Kong” and sang a protest song as Premier League champions Manchester City hammered Kitchee 6-1 on Wednesday, underlining the political turmoil that has gripped the city.
Bayern Munich target Leroy Sane scored twice, Raheem Sterling got one and set up two more and teenagers Nabil Touaizi and Iker Pozo were also on the scoresheet as Pep Guardiola’s City outclassed the Hong Kong league side.
In the 21st minute of each half, marking an attack by a stick-wielding mob on July 21, fans struck up “Do You Hear the People Sing”, the Les Miserables song which has been adopted as a protest anthem, followed by loud chants of “Free Hong Kong!”
One banner unfurled among the 20,926-strong Hong Kong Stadium crowd said: “No China extradition, HK = police state, please save HK!!”
It follows weeks of protests in the semi-autonomous territory sparked by a government bid, since shelved, to allow extradition to mainland China for certain offences.
The protests, which have morphed into demonstrations for democratic reform and a halt to sliding freedoms, have seen sporadic clashes including an attack Sunday by suspected triad gangsters which left dozens wounded.
It added a layer of intrigue to what was otherwise a routine win for Manchester City, who conclude their pre-season Asian tour in Japan this weekend before playing Liverpool in the Community Shield a week later.
On a sweltering evening, a sharp-looking Sterling rattled the bar in just the second minute and then set up the first goal for David Villa, who lifted the ball calmly over the Kitchee ‘keeper.
Sterling also provided the final pass as Sane, the subject of persistent transfer interest from Bayern Munich, drilled City’s second five minutes from half-time.
England striker Sterling made it 3-0 with a neat finish just before the break before Sane grabbed his second with a turn and shot from a tight angle after Kevin De Bruyne’s thumping strike.
Spanish teenager Touaizi came on to score City’s fifth 10 minutes from time but the biggest cheer of the night was for Kitchee’s Law Tsz-chun, who grabbed a consolation goal for the Hong Kong side.
Pozo, another 18-year-old City whizz-kid, poached their sixth goal shortly before another apparent political protest on the 90th minute, when a black-shirted pitch invader ran to the centre circle and exhorted the crowd.
Football has often set the stage for political protest in Hong Kong, where fans routinely boo their own national team’s anthem, “March of the Volunteers”, which they share with mainland China.

The 32-year-old Serbian, who outlasted Roger Federer in an epic All-England Club final earlier this month, was joined by Argentina’s 12th-ranked Juan Martin Del Potro in pulling out of the ATP Masters Canada tournament.
“I’m sorry to announce that I decided to pull out of Rogers Cup,” Djokovic said in a statement released by Tennis Canada. “With the support of my team, I have decided to give my body longer rest and recovery time before coming back again to play.
“I love Canada and I have many friends there that always make me feel like I’m at home and I’m looking forward to coming back again to play in front of all of you in Montreal.”
Djokovic’s withdrawal means Spanish star Rafael Nadal, an 18-time Grand Slam singles champion, will be the top seed in Montreal when main draw begins August 5. Nadal has captured the Canadian crown four times, most recently last year by defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final.
Djokovic has won the Canadian event that alternates between Toronto and Montreal four times, twice in each city -- Toronto in 2012 and 2016 and Montreal in 2007 and 2011.
He was ousted last year in Toronto by Greek star Tsitsipas in the third round.
“We would have loved for Djokovic to have the chance to be crowned champion for a third time in Montreal, but we understand his decision and we wish him a quick return for the rest of the season,” Montreal tournament director Eugene Lapierre said.
Del Potro was injured last month at Queen’s and underwent right knee patella surgery and is undergoing rehabilitation for the setback.
“In del Potro’s case, we wish him a speedy recovery, he who has experienced his share of injuries in the past few years,” Lapierre said. “We look forward to seeing him back on court in the near future.”
World number three Federer said after his Wimbledon final loss that he too intended to skip Montreal.
Frenchman Richard Gasquet and Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan will take the two available spots in the Montreal main draw as a result of the withdrawals by Djokovic and Del Potro.

TravelTriangle and PharmEasy are two startups backed by the fund. The latter was the last investment he made via Fundamentum, as per Crunchbase, in September last year. He stressed that with the pace at which innovation happens around the world, it is “very difficult for the government and the regulator to keep pace with that, it is just the nature of the beast,” Nandan Nilekani said with respect to the issue of data localisation in India and regulations surrounding localisation of payment data. “India is both doing technology innovation and enabling legal infrastructure around this technology. This (data localisation) is a global issue as sometimes innovation goes ahead of technology, law and so on,” he added. While technology and innovation are going back and forth but India will have a far better regime of both of them to deal with the modern issue of these things, Nandan Nilekani added. The government has asked the RBI, as reported by PTI last week, to look at concerns around its data localisation rules that mandates domestic storage of customer data without creating mirror sites overseas.  Through a circular in April 2018, RBI had asked for “data relating to payment systems” to be “stored in a system only in India” within six months. “RBI has taken a view that as India has more and more digital payments, having uninterrupted digital payments is vital,” Nandan Nilekani said."

Increasingly intense heatwaves are linked to manmade climate change, the WMO added.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-weather-greenland/europes-record-heatwave-threatens-greenland-ice-sheet-idUKKCN1UL14U?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,"Clare Nullis, spokeswoman for the U.N. World Meteorological Organization, said the hot air moving up from North Africa had not merely broken European temperature records on Thursday but surpassed them by 2, 3 or 4 degrees Celsius, which she described as “absolutely incredible”. “According to forecasts, and this is of concern, the atmospheric flow is now going to transport that heat towards Greenland,” she told a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva. “This will result in high temperatures and consequently enhanced melting of the Greenland ice sheet,” she said. “We don’t know yet whether it will beat the 2012 level, but its close.” Nullis cited data from Denmark’s Polar Portal, which measures the daily gains and losses in surface mass of the Greenland Ice Sheet. “In July alone, it lost 160 billion tonnes of ice through surface melting. That’s roughly the equivalent of 64 million Olympic-sized swimming pools. Just in July. Just surface melt - it’s not including ocean melt as well.” The Greenland Ice Sheet covers 80% of the island and has developed over many thousands of years, with layers of snow compressed into ice. The dome of ice rises to a height of 3,000 meters and the total volume of the ice sheet is approximately 2,900,000 cubic kilometres, which would raise global sea levels by 7 metres if it melted entirely, according to the Polar Portal website. Greenland had not had exceptional weather this year until June, but its ice had been melting rapidly in recent weeks, she said. The warmer air also had implications for Arctic ice extent, which was nearly the lowest on record as of July 15, Nullis said. She said increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves were linked to manmade climate change. “What we saw with this one was that temperature records weren’t just broken, they were smashed.” She cited a study by the Britain’s Met Office which found that by 2050, record-breaking heatwaves would happen every other year."

They said businessman Puri was to be confronted with some evidence during questioning at an Enforcement Directorate office here on Friday. However, Puri sought some break time from the investigating officer of the case to go to the washroom but slipped away, officials alleged. It is understood that agency officials then tried to call him over his mobile phone but it was off. The agency is now mulling to summon him again for questioning, they said. Puri, Chairman of Hindustan Power projects Pvt Ltd, has been grilled by the agency in this case in the past too. He is the son of Nita and Deepak Puri, the CMD of optical storage media firm Moser Baer. Nita is Nath’s sister. The about Rs 3,600 crore deal to purchase AgustaWestland choppers for the VVIPs was scrapped by India over allegations of corruption and kick backs being paid in the deal. The ED and the CBI are probing the case and have already filed multiple charge sheets in the case."

The MT Riah was detained by the Iranian coastguard on July 13, with 12 Indian crew members on board, the Indian foreign ministry said. “Nine crew members have been released and they will be on their way to India soon,” foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said. “Our mission in Iran has requested the concerned Iranian authorities for the release of remaining crew members.” No reason was provided as to why the three were being held.  Iranian state TV aired footage of the vessel a few days after it was seized, saying it had been detained by Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards for smuggling fuel. Indian and Iranian authorities said this week Iran had granted India consular access to 18 Indian crew seized on another ship, the British-flagged Stena Impero that Iran seized in the Strait of Hormuz on July 19. The seizure of the British tanker in the world’s most important waterway for the oil trade has deepened a crisis between Iran and the West that was triggered in May when the United States tightened sanctions, effectively barring all countries from buying Iranian oil. Iran said it had seized the Stena Impero because it had collided with a fishing boat. India’s junior foreign minister, V. Muraleedharan, said India was pushing for the release of the Indian crew on the British vessel.  India has had long-standing political and energy ties with Iran, but it has cut off all its oil supplies from it because of U.S. sanctions."
Nandini Sinha,"Plates, furniture used as weapons in mass brawl on cruise ship","Plates and furniture were used as weapons in a mass brawl on a British cruise ship after a group took offence at another passenger dressed as a clown, a journalist who was on board said. The group had specifically booked a cruise ship with no fancy dress, a witness told the journalist. Six people were injured in the brawl.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7292241/Violence-high-seas-clown-sparks-mass-brawl-aboard-P-O-cruise-liner-Britannia.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Two people have been arrested after a man dressed as a clown sparked a violent brawl on a cruise ship. A 43-year-old man and a 41-year-old woman, both from Chigwell, Essex, are in custody following the fight which saw plates and furniture thrown during a black tie event. Families ran from brawlers in the 16th floor Horizon restaurant of the P&O Britannia ship as it was making its way back to Southampton from Norway at 2am on Friday. Six people - three men and three women - were assaulted during the ten-minute ordeal and a number of people suffered significant bruising and cuts. The party started as the ship left Bergen, Norway, just after 2.30pm on Thursday and the fight broke out in the early hours of Friday morning, before the liner docked at Southampton at 6.45am on Saturday. There had been a booze-fuelled 'patriotic' event on board the vessel as its week-long trip to the Norwegian fjords came to a close. A female entertainer who works on the ship said: 'There was a person dressed as a clown and this upset the other passengers. 'Things got out of hand very quickly, people had been drinking, and there was a fight. 'Chairs and plates were being thrown, people were very angry. 'It was shocking to see and some of the staff and passengers were scared and had to hide.' Another female employee, in her 20s, added: 'There was a lot of shouting, it was very scary. 'The police have dealt with it now.' Martin Symons, 54, from Plymouth, who was on the cruise, told Mail Online: 'I saw four people fighting and they were pulling hair and shouting. 'There were two men who looked like they were the women's husbands. 'One of the men was out of control, he had his shirt all ripped open and stuff. 'He was actually beating up who seemed to be one of the other man's wife. 'They were being kicked in the head and one woman's earrings were pulled out.'  GMTV correspondent Richard Galsford, who was on the cruise, tweeted that there was 'blood everywhere.' He added: 'The buffet area was immediately sealed off as medical teams went to help the injured. 'Staff told me they'd never experienced anything like it and those behind the violence were confined to a cabin for the last day of the cruise, waiting for police here in Southampton.' The incident came on the final leg of a week long cruise to Norway's fjords that was en route back to its Southampton port. The buffet area was sealed while medical teams tended to injured staff and those who started the fight were moved to their cabins. A P&O spokesman said: 'Following an incident on board Britannia on Thursday evening we can confirm that all guests have now disembarked and the matter is now in the hands of the local police.' A police van and two patrol cars were today seen leaving the Southampton terminal where the ship is docked, before leaving for a Mediterranean cruise later today. Hampshire Police confirmed officers had attended the ship, with witnesses claiming there was around two dozen at the terminal when it arrived. A spokesman for the force said: 'Officers attended after a number of people were assaulted on-board a cruise ship. 'Six people, three men and three women were assaulted. A number of injuries were suffered including significant bruising and cuts.' They added: 'The incident took place during the early hours of Friday, 26 July on-board P&O's Britannia while it was enroute to Southampton from Bergen.' The force appealed for anyone with footage of the brawl to contact them.  One shocked passenger, who was at Southampton port today to board the ship for its next cruise to the Mediterranean, said he hoped another fight would not happen on his trip. Retired Julian Gates, 67, who is going on the cruise with his wife Mary, said: 'I read about what had happened before I left this morning. 'It's shocking that something like that would happen while on a cruise. I have been on a few now and it's such a relaxing experience, you don't want it ruined by fighting. 'Hopefully, it won't happen again while we are away because that's not what you pay for.' Britannia is the largest of P&O's seven vessels, carrying almost 3,700 passengers at a time. It is currently in the middle of a two month stint of cruises of the Norwegian Fjords and Mediterranean, with the former lasting seven days and the latter 14."
Krishna Veera Vanamali,Trump says US could tax French wine in retaliation for digital tax,"US President Donald Trump has threatened to tax French wines in retaliation for France's recent proposal to levy a tax aimed at large US technology companies. ""I've always said American wine is better than French wine!"" Trump tweeted. France urged the US not to bring trade tariffs into the debate on ""fair taxation of digital activities"".",https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-france/trump-says-u-s-could-tax-french-wine-in-retaliation-for-digital-tax-idINKCN1UL291?il=0&utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Trump had told French President Emmanuel Macron last week that he was concerned about the proposed digital services tax. “If anybody taxes them, it should be their home Country, the USA. We will announce a substantial reciprocal action on Macron’s foolishness shortly,” Trump tweeted on Friday. “I’ve always said American wine is better than French wine!” Later in the Oval Office, Trump told reporters the tax decision was wrong and he threatened the key French export. “They shouldn’t have done this,” Trump said. “I told them, I said, ‘Don’t do it because if you do it, I’m going to tax your wine.’” He said a few minutes later that the U.S. response would be announced soon, saying that it “might be on wine, it might be on something else.” Trump and Macron spoke by telephone on Friday and discussed the tax and next month’s summit of the Group of 7 rich nations in France, the White House said. Macron’s office said the French leader “underlined that the G7 summit would be an important opportunity to move towards a universal taxation of digital activities, which is in our common interest, and which we need to keep working on in order to obtain a broad international agreement.” The United States is by far the largest single export market for French wine and spirits, which is France’s second-biggest export after aerospace. The United States in 2018 accounted for nearly a quarter of all French wine exports, or 3.2 billion euros’ ($3.6 billion) worth. French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said in a statement after Trump’s tweet that “the universal taxation of digital activities is a challenge that concerns all of us. We want to reach a deal on this within the framework of the G7 and the OECD. In the meantime, France will move ahead with national decisions.” White House spokesman Judd Deere said the United States “is extremely disappointed by France’s decision to adopt a digital services tax at the expense of U.S. companies and workers. France’s unilateral measure appears to target innovative U.S. technology firms that provide services in distinct sectors of the economy.” He added, “The administration is looking closely at all other policy tools.” Two weeks ago, the French Senate approved the 3% levy that will apply to revenue from digital services earned in France by companies with more than 25 million euros in French revenue and 750 million euros ($834 million) worldwide. Other EU countries, including Austria, Britain, Spain and Italy, have also announced plans for their own digital taxes. They say a levy is needed because big, multinational internet companies such as Facebook and Amazon are able to book profits in low-tax countries like Ireland, no matter where the revenue originates. Earlier this month, the United States threatened tariffs on an additional $4 billion worth of European Union goods, including wine, cheese and whiskey - that could be hit with tariffs as part of a nearly 15-year-long dispute at the World Trade Organization over aircraft subsidies given to U.S. planemaker Boeing Co and its European rival, Airbus SE. The EU’s director general for trade, Sabine Weyand, this week said she expected the Trump administration to proceed to implement some of the tariffs after a WTO arbitrator ruled on the damage caused to Boeing as a result of illegal EU government aid to Airbus. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said France’s new digital services tax “targets U.S. firms almost exclusively and largely spares French companies.” The U.S. Trade Representative’s Office (USTR) last month said it would hold a hearing on Aug. 19 in its probe of the planned tax, which could lead to the United States imposing new tariffs or other trade restrictions. USTR could issue new tariffs on French goods after the public comment period closes on Aug. 26. USTR said the levy was an “unreasonable tax policy.” The plan departs from tax norms because of “extraterritoriality; taxing revenue not income; and a purpose of penalizing particular technology companies for their commercial success,” it said. The tax is due to apply retroactively from the start of 2019, which USTR said calls into question its fairness."

The certificate has to be issued by an authorised scrapping agency, according to proposed amendments in draft rules issued by the road transport and highways ministry on Friday. “It has been provided that the newly purchased motor vehicles shall be exempted for the payment of fees for the purpose of issue of registration certificate and assignment of new registration mark subject to condition that motor vehicle is presented for the registration along with the scrapping certificate of the previously owned vehicle of same category issued by the authorised scrapping centre/agency and the scrapping certificate not utilised for any other such cases in the past,"" the ministry said. Besides this, the ministry has proposed renewal of fitness certificates every six months instead of a year, for vehicles older than 15 years. If implemented, the move can discourage vehicle owners from using old cars. Besides, the government has proposed to increase the feesfor conducting tests and obtaining renewal certificate if the vehicle is more than 15 years old, along with an additional ₹50 per day for any delay after the expiry of the vehicle’s fitness certificate. The government has been trying to encourage the scrapping of old vehicles, to curb pollution and improve air quality. It has also been trying to encourage the use of battery operated or electric vehicles (EVs) such that citizens have cleaner air to breathe. The ministry has proposed hiking new registration and renewal fee for vehicles, while scrapping the same for EVs. The road transport and highways ministry has proposed a sharp increase in registration fee as well as renewal of registration fee of petrol/diesel car. One may have to shell out ₹2,000 for renewal of registration of motorcycle, which is currently ₹50. Similarly, in the case of three-wheelers, the fee will increase to ₹5,000 from ₹300 now. There would also be a monthly additional charge for delay in applying for renewal for certificate of registration. The ministry has also proposed to do away with registration fees for two-, three-, and four-wheelers running on battery (EVs), to create an ecosystem to enable adoption of such vehicles."

The 30-year-old Welshman has already been told by Real coach Zinedine Zidane that he does not form part of his future plans at the Spanish giants. Spanish daily Marca claimed that Bale, who has been at Real since 2013 since signing from Tottenham, will earn 22 million euros per season in China and that the deal is almost finalised. However, later reports by Sky Sports in England suggested the player’s representatives were negotiating a mind-boggling 1 million pounds a week contract before the Chinese transfer window shuts on Wednesday. Real boss Zidane said last weekend he thought it would be “best for everyone” if Bale’s departure could be arranged quickly -- comments Bale’s agent branded “disrespectful” of a player who helped the side to a Spanish league title and four Champions Leagues since arriving from Tottenham six years ago. Zidane then insisted Monday he meant no disrespect before Bale came on as a substitute in a midweek 3-2 friendly win over Arsenal in the United States. “He had a good game and I’m happy for him,” Zidane said. “I do not know what’s going to happen, for now he’s with us. It did not change anything.” Bale’s agent Jonathan Barnett has already insisted that any deal which sees the Welshman leave the Bernabeu would have to be a permanent one and not one that sees him shipped out on loan. “There will be no makeshift deals to get him out of the club,” said Barnett. “Gareth is one of the best players on the planet.

I thought it wasn’t... not even close to a fair contest between bat and ball throughout the whole game,” ESPN Cricinfo quoted Root as saying. England were bundled out for 85 in the first innings as Tim Murtagh scalped five wickets. Ireland went on to score 207 runs, gaining a 122-run lead, but England managed to score 303 runs in their second innings, giving Ireland a target of 182 runs. Ireland clearly showed inexperience as they were dismissed for 38 (seventh-lowest total in the history of Test cricket), handing England a win by 143 runs. Chris Woakes scalped six wickets in the second innings whereas Stuart Broad picked up four. Despite the win, Root said that the team was not at their best in the match. “We weren’t at our best by any stretch. We managed certain periods very well. We were put under pressure by Ireland. They exploited the conditions on that first morning in particular extremely well,” Root said. “But we found a way to win a game. First innings, last innings, when you are getting scores like that, that tells a story in itself when the scores are as low as that on a surface that you play on,” he added. England will next take on Australia in the Ashes and the team is expected to announce their squad later today. Root said the team would be ready for the Ashes challenge. “Yeah, pretty confident. We’ll have a final meeting today at some point and make sure that we’re all very clear but it’s an exciting time for everyone. It’s nice to go into it with this win and to have managed some pressure situations, come out the other side,” Root said. “But you know Ashes cricket is very special and the guys will be getting very much their minds around that now, the next few days off and then when we turn to practice it will be all go,” he added. The Ashes is slated to begin on August 1."

Nadda also lashed out at other political parties, alleging they “lacked” the will to serve the nation and were only “hankering after” chairs. The former Union health minister said the work done by the Modi government in the past 50 days would prove to be a milestone in making India a USD 5-trillion economy. “Today, we are the world’s biggest party. We are not competing against anyone, we are trying to break our own record. Under the membership drive, we have enrolled more than 11 crore members and now we have kept a target of 20 crore. “There is no competition. Even all the other political parties say they are behind the BJP and they cannot match the saffron party,” Nadda said, addressing party workers here. His Haryana visit assumes significance as the state is likely to go to polls in October this year. During his two-day visit, Nadda will meet senior BJP leaders and discuss the preparations ahead of the assembly polls. Criticising political opponents, Nadda said they are into politics for their “vested interests”. “There are 1,300 political parties in the country and in these outfits, somebody’s son is doing politics, somebody is into politics because they belong to some particular caste and dynasty. The BJP is the only party, where an ordinary man can reach the top position in politics,” he said. Citing the examples of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, he said they came from ordinary families and rose to the top positions in politics. “Ours is the only political party which has got democratic values,” he said. “BJP is the only party which has everything including leader, policy, intention, worker etc. You ask any political party about its policy, they will not be able to utter two words on it. They just only want chairs. They lack will to serve nation,” he said. Nadda further said, “When we say Congress-free nation, it does not mean only Congress party. We mean corruption-free, commission-free India.” Listing out the Modi government’s achievements in the past 50 days, he said the government’s work focused on the weaker section of the society and strengthening of economy. “Do you know that the work done in past 50 days by Modi government would be a milestone in making India a USD 5-trillion economy,” he said in his address to party workers. He talked about the target of building 1.95 crore houses for the poor and drinking water supply for rural households and amendment to labour laws. Nadda lauded the Manohar Lal Khattar-led government in Haryana, saying it provided a corruption-free dispensation and brought transparency in government jobs."

""This (BJP's) is not a constitutionally or ethically formed government. How will they (BJP) prove majority then? Has it got any recognition within the framework of the constitution?"" Siddaramaiah asked. He said the H D Kumaraswamy led coalition government would not have collapsed if the MLAs of Congress and the JD(S) were not confined. ""They (BJP) confined our MLAs illegally by luring them and now they (BJP) are saying it is the victory of people. No, it is not the victory of people. It is the victory of horse-trading,"" Siddaramaiah said. The former Chief Minister claimed that two rebel MLAs had called him regarding their disqualification but he did not receive their calls. Four days after the coalition government collapsed, BJP leader Yediyurappa staked claim to form the government and took oath as chief minister on Friday."
Kanishka Pandey,18 mn-yr-old remains of world's smallest fossil monkey found,"America's Duke University and Peru's National University of Piura scientists have uncovered 18-million-year-old remains of the world's smallest fossil monkey ever found. The remains were found on an exposed riverbank along Río Alto Madre de Dios in southeastern Peru. The specimen is important because it helps bridge a 15-million-year gap in the fossil record for New World monkeys, scientists said.",https://www.today.duke.edu/2019/07/worlds-smallest-fossil-monkey-found-amazon-jungle?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"DURHAM, N.C. -- A team of Peruvian and American scientists have uncovered the 18-million-year-old remains of the smallest fossil monkey ever found. A fossilized tooth found in Peru’s Amazon jungle has been identified as belonging to a new species of tiny monkey no heavier than a hamster. The specimen is important because it helps bridge a 15-million-year gap in the fossil record for New World monkeys, says a team led by Duke University and the National University of Piura in Peru. The new fossil was unearthed from an exposed river bank along the Río Alto Madre de Dios in southeastern Peru. There, researchers dug up chunks of sandstone and gravel, put them in bags, and hauled them away to be soaked in water and then strained through sieves to filter out the fossilized teeth, jaws, and bone fragments buried within. The team searched through some 2,000 pounds of sediment containing hundreds of fossils of rodents, bats and other animals before they spotted the lone monkey tooth. “Primate fossils are as rare as hen’s teeth,” said first author Richard Kay, a professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke who has been doing paleontological research in South America for nearly four decades. A single upper molar, the specimen was just “double the size of the head of a pin” and “could fall through a window screen,” Kay said. Paleontologists can tell a lot from monkey teeth, particularly molars. Based on the tooth’s relative size and shape, the researchers think the animal likely dined on energy-rich fruits and insects, and weighed in at less than half a pound -- only slightly heavier than a baseball. Some of South America’s larger monkeys, such as howlers and muriquis, can grow to 50 times that heft. “It’s by far the smallest fossil monkey that’s ever been found worldwide,” Kay said. Only one monkey species alive today, the teacup-sized pygmy marmoset, is smaller, “but barely,” Kay said. In a paper published online July 23 in the Journal of Human Evolution, the team dubbed the animal Parvimico materdei, or “tiny monkey from the Mother of God River.” Now stored in the permanent collections of the Institute of Paleontology of Peru’s National University of Piura, the find is important because it’s one of the few clues scientists have from a key missing chapter in monkey evolution. Monkeys are thought to have arrived in South America from Africa some 40 million years ago, quickly diversifying into the 150-plus New World species we know today, most of which inhabit the Amazon rainforest. Yet exactly how that process unfolded is a bit of a mystery, in large part because of a gap in the monkey fossil record between 13 and 31 million years ago with only a few fragments.  In that gap lies Parvimico. The new fossil dates back 17 to 19 million years, which puts it “smack dab in the time and place when we would have expected diversification to have occurred in the New World monkeys,” Kay said. The team is currently on another fossil collecting expedition in the Peruvian Amazon that will wrap up in August, concentrating their efforts in remote river sites with 30-million-year-old sediments. “If we find a primate there, that would really be pay dirt,” Kay said."

The Union Home Ministry sent a directive to the Chief Secretary, Jammu and Kashmir, stating that the additional forces will strengthen the anti-terrorist operation and help to maintain law and order. According to the directive, 50 companies of CRPF, 30 companies from SSB, and 10 companies each from the BSF and ITBP have been deployed additionally with the existing forces. The directive also details about the troops who will be deployed on the occasion of Independence Day on 15th August. The decision from the Centre comes days after NSA Ajit Doval's visit to the insurgency-hit state which is under President's rule. Last February, around 100 companies of extra troops were deployed in the state ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. Political parties slammed the move with former IAS officer and J&K People's Party chief Shah Faesal suspecting ""something sinister."" Lashing out at the central government, PDP chief and former CM Mehbooba Mufti said that the Jammu and Kashmir conflict is a “political problem” and that it cannot be solved by “military means”."
