Anmol Sharma,"It was my dream to play WC, was difficult to not be picked: Iyer","Batsman Shreyas Iyer, who has been selected in India's ODI and T20I squads for West Indies tour, has revealed it was difficult for him to not get selected in India's World Cup squad. ""It was my dream to play the World Cup for my country,"" he further said. ""I just kept myself positive and always in high spirits,"" he added.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/it-was-difficult-to-not-get-selected-shreyas-iyer-believes-getting-in-and-out-of-side-doesn-t-create-good-pattern/story-x8709sB99URBxx6U8BsbgK.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"Every player wants a sense of security and Shreyas Iyer is no different as he believes that “getting in and out of the team doesn’t create a good pattern” and dents a player’s self belief in the long run. Indian Premier League’s youngest captain, the 24-year-old Iyer, who guided Delhi Capitals to their first play-offs in seven years, is getting ready for the upcoming limited overs series in the Caribbean having earned a recall after a disappointing World Cup snub.
This is his second coming and he wants a few more chances that will help him cement his place in the side.
“If you are really a good talent, then you need a certain amount of chances to prove yourself and get acclimatised to the conditions,” Iyer told PTI in an exclusive interview.
“If you keep coming in and going out (of the team), it doesn’t really set a good pattern for one’s self and you start disbelieving yourself. If you are a great talent, then you need some time,” feels the talented Mumbaikar, who has played 6 ODIs and an equal number of T20 Internationals.
Having stacked up consistent performances at the domestic and A level, Iyer said that at times one tends to lose patience but the only mantra is to perform.
“Yes, you tend to lose patience but selection is not in your hands. All you can do is perform, perform and perform and that’s what I enjoy doing,” he said when asked about times when someone is repeatedly ignored.
“You have to keep performing and keep showing people that you are capable of playing at the higher league. Once you get that sniff, you never look back,” Iyer, who enjoys 50 plus average (52.18) over 54 first-class games and a healthy 42.93 in List A matches, said.
He is confident that he will certainly play a World Cup in future even as the 2019 exclusion rankles him.
“Yes there was a lot of buzz about me before the World Cup selection because I was consistent and aware about the hardwork and smart work that I had put in. It will definitely reap benefits and help me in future when I play for India,” he said.
Iyer fully understands that it was a specific team combination that was the reason he was being overlooked and hence he always remained in high spirits.
“It was difficult to not get selected. It was my dream to play the World Cup for my country. I know there are a few opportunities that I got but unfortunately the team combination was such that it didn’t demand me to be there,” said Iyer, who is a practical sort of person, something that was reflected in his decision making during crunch IPL games.
“I just kept myself positive and always in high spirits. It didn’t disturb me from inside at all. It was a dream to play the World Cup and I will play for sure in the future,” he added.
An attacking player with a wide array of strokes in his repertoire, Iyer believes in not tinkering too much with his process as long as he knows that it wasn’t dearth of effort.
“I have to believe in my process and I know I follow a certain pattern to score runs. I have to believe that I will be getting runs if I have a certain mindset and I know I will. “Self belief is the key to success and that has helped me. So I will put in all my efforts in the manner I know. If it works, it is great and if it doesn’t it’s still great as I know I have put in all my effort,” he exuded confidence.
In his endeavour to seek constant improvement, Iyer is working on two specific strokes pull and sweep.
“You have to always work on your batting as you are never perfect. I am working on my batting everyday and trying to perfect a few shots that will help me score all around the world. “Pull and sweep are two shots which can help me score runs outside India. These are two shots that can immediately put pressure back on bowlers,” Iyer reasoned.
His comeback has happened after a successful ‘A’ one day series, where his half-centuries were instrumental in two of the four victories recorded by India A.
“The A tour has always given me an opportunity to prove myself in the higher league as this is the stepping stone. I was in West Indies for the List A series and I had an idea of how the pitches play and also it’s so hot out there that you need to keep yourself hydrated.
“These are little things that you learn as you start playing,” he signed off.

Apaar Sharma,"Cong, NCP leaders ready to join BJP, few will be included: Fadnavis","Responding to NCP chief Sharad Pawar's claim that BJP was poaching leaders from Opposition parties by misusing power and agencies, Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis said, ""Many Congress and NCP leaders are ready to join BJP but a few chosen ones will be inducted."" Fadnavis added BJP won't induct those leaders who are being probed by Enforcement Directorate or other agencies.",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/many-congress-ncp-leaders-willing-to-join-bjp-but-only-selective-few-getting-inducted-devendra-fadnavis/460280?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,"Hitting back at National Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar's claims that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is poaching leaders of other parties, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday said the BJP is not approaching leaders of other parties rather it's just the opposite. There are many political leaders from different parties who want to join the BJP, however, only a few chose ones would be inducted into the party, said Fadnavis.
When asked about Pawar's claims of the BJP poaching NCP and Congress leaders ahead of Maharashtra Assembly elections, Devendra Fadnavis said that many political leaders are ready to join the BJP but only a selective few will be allowed to join. He added that politicians who are involved in any ongoing investigation by the Enforcement Directorate or any investigative agency will not be inducted into the party.
""BJP has never done politics of pressurising others. In the last five years, the government has helped several sugar factories facing difficult times. There's a long list but no one was asked to join BJP for this. We don't need to invite or chase anyone, people are approaching us,"" said the Maharashtra CM. Fadnavis then took a direct dig at the NCP chief saying before making claims of poaching, Sharad Pawar should introspect within his own party.
Earlier in the day, Sharad Pawar reiterated that the Central government is misusing its power before the 2019 Maharashtra elections, pressuring those leaders who are not willing to join BJP. This is not limited to Maharashtra, it has happened everywhere, said Pawar.
Yesterday, Sharad Pawar has said that the BJP is using investigative agencies to force politicians into joining them. ""Take the example of the IT raid in Kolhapur. He (Mushrif) was asked to come to the party (BJP) before this raid. When he refused, the IT raid followed,"" said the former Maharashtra CM.
The war of words between the two leaders has broken out in the wake of an exodus of leaders from NCP to BJP and its ally Shiv Sena. In last one week, NCP's Mumbai chief Sachin Ahir has joined Shiv Sena, party's women wing president Chitra Wagh has resigned from the party and MLA Vaibhav Pichad will join BJP soon. NCP leaders Indrakneel Naik and Silip Sopal are also touted to join the ranks of Shiv Sena.

Utkarsh Kumar,We'll back IOA's decision to snub 2022 CWG: Rifle Association,"A day after Indian Olympic Association (IOA) proposed a boycott of the 2022 Birmingham Commonwealth Games for dropping shooting from the roster, National Rifle Association (NRAI) said, ""We are with IOA."" NRAI added, ""We are a part of the IOA so whatever action IOA is taking, we have to back them."" Shooters are losing a big opportunity, NRAI further stated.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/other-sports/we-are-with-ioa-says-rifle-association-on-2022-cwg-boycott-plan/story-YusB1rEHXTgW5f9L0uauIM.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"The National Rifle Association (NRAI) of India has backed the Indian Olympic Association’s proposal to completely boycott the 2022 Commonwealth Games, for excluding shooting from the sporting event.
NRAI Secretary Rajeev Bhatia and General Secretary DV Seetharama Rao on Sunday said the NRAI has faith in Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and will back whatever decision the IOA takes.
This comes after Indian Olympic Association IOA President Narinder Batra wrote to Union Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Kiren Rijiju, urging him to boycott the 2022 CWG games in the UK due to exclusion of shooting.
“We are a national sports federation, we are a part of the IOA so whatever action IOA is taking, we have to back them. We are with IOA. We are number one in the world now in shooting. We have gone ahead of China and the UK. The government will eventually take the final call,” Rao, General Secretary, NRAI told ANI.
“It’s a good step taken by IOA President, shooters are looking positively at this that something positive will come out. Whatever action IOA takes, we will support them. Everybody is disappointed as shooters are losing a big opportunity, everyone wants to win medals,” Bhatia, Secretary, NRAI told ANI.
In the letter addressed to Rijiju, Batra said that the IOA has decided that India will not attend the Congress of CWG in Kigali, Rwanda, from September 3 to 5 later this year.
He added that the IOA has come to a decision that names of Rajeev Mehta and Namdev Shirgaonker for VP Regional and Member Sports Committee, respectively, will be withdrawn from the CWG election.
“We want to express our protest by not taking part in 2022 CWG Games in the UK to make the CWG understand that India is not prepared to take India bashing anymore and the people with a particular mindset in the CWG need to understand that India got its independence in 1947 and India is not a colony of anyone anymore and is now the 5th largest economy in the world and by far the fastest-growing economy in the world,” the letter had said.
The IOA president further said that India bagged most of the medals in shooting category and by removing it India’s position will come down.
In 2010 CWG, India had finished second in overall medals tally and total medals won in the shooting only were 30. In 2018, India had finished third with 16 medals in shooting.
“By removing shooting from CWG 2022 the medal ranking of India will go down from third in 2018 to anywhere between fifth to eighth in CWG 2022 and the total number of medals won in 2018, that is, 66 will also come down,” the letter had said.
“Even though the government, NSF and IOA will be working hard for CWG 2022, the impression that will go down is of bad performance because the overall number of total medals may come down along with the overall ranking based on medal’s won,” it added.
Batra also highlighted that India does not have a single member in the CWG Executive Council or in any functional committees of CWG.
“It will be very interesting to note that India does not have even a single member in CWG Executive Council and nor does it have a single member in any of the functional committees of CWG,” the letter had said.
Batra, however, acknowledged that the issue is yet to be discussed with athletes, stakeholders and government.
He said that whenever India’s position is good in shooting either goalposts are shifted or rules are changed.
“We have been noticing over the period of time that wherever India seems to get a grip of the game and performing well, then somehow we find that either the goalposts are shifted or rules are changed. We feel it is time for us in IOA/India to start asking tough questions and start taking positions,” the letter said.

Spread across 1,800 feet, Flipkart’s furniture experience centre in Bengaluru aims to give customers a glimpse into the selection offered along with creating awareness around seamless buying and installation, said the company on Sunday.
This move underscores the importance of having an offline presence for categories such as furniture, which still requires a touch-and-feel format for customers.
""The furniture category has traditionally had a strong presence offline, because customers like to see and touch the products they are buying,"" said Adarsh Menon, vice-president of furniture, electronics and private label at Flipkart. “The idea behind the FurniSure Experience Zone is to allow customers to explore Flipkart Furniture’s offerings in a new and innovative fashion,"" Menon added.
Flipkart is also working with Google as customers visiting the experience centre can also scan the catalogue through Google Lens. Flipkart Furniture plans to introduce two more experience centres in Bengaluru, while also looking to expand to other metros.
Furniture is one of the faster growing online categories, witnessing an upsurge in customer demand from across metros as well as tier- 2 and tier-3 towns, thus expanding the market size for online furniture in India to $17 billion in 2018.
This development also comes at a time when Swedish furniture retailer Ikea is looking to expand its presence in India.
Vertical e-commerce players in the furniture space such as Pepperfry, Urban Ladder and Livspace also have been focusing on offline over the last few years.
Earlier this year, Pepperfry said that it would infuse $12 million to set up over 100 offline stores as it drives immense customer engagement for the company. The firm currently has around 42 such stores.
Similarly, Urban Ladder, too, has been increasing its focus on offline expansion. During the last 1-1.5 years, Urban Ladder opened at least six large-format stores, with more to be launched in the pipeline.

Dharna,"ICICI Bank posts Q1 profit of ₹1,908 crore","India's second-largest private lender ICICI Bank reported a profit of ₹1,908 crore in the June quarter, compared to a ₹120-crore loss in the year-ago period, driven by lower bad-loan provisioning. Its provisions declined 41.5% year-on-year in the quarter to ₹3,496 crore, with bad loans falling 51%. The bank's net interest income rose 27% to ₹7,737 crore year-on-year for the quarter.",https://in.reuters.com/article/icici-bank-results/lower-provisions-help-icici-bank-swing-to-first-quarter-profit-idINKCN1UN051?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts,"ICICI Bank Ltd, India’s second-largest private lender, reported a quarterly profit on Saturday compared with a loss a year earlier, helped by lower provisions and higher retail loan growth.
Net profit for the fiscal first quarter ended June 30 was 19.08 billion rupees ($277.04 million), compared with a loss of 1.20 bln rupees in the same period a year ago, the bank said in a statement.
But the profit fell slightly short of the average forecast of 20.87 billion rupees from 19 analysts, according to Refinitiv data.
ICICI, like its peers, also said India’s ongoing economic slowdown weighed on its performance in the quarter.
“From an economic scenario there is a bit of a slowdown in consumption as well as in auto sales,” said Sandeep Batra, Executive Director of ICICI Bank in a conference call after the results. “However, the services sector continues to do well and we are seeing an improvement in the capital expenditure cycle.”
The bank’s corporate loan book grew at a pace of 13% in the quarter, while its retail loan book grew 22% in the period.
ICICI, which has been under pressure lately due to rising bad loans, said net non-performing assets (NPA) at the end of the June quarter were down 51% to $1.17 billion. The net NPA was at a 14-quarter low of 1.77%, said the bank’s management.
Quarterly provisions fell to $507 million from $865 million a year ago.
Net interest margin, a key indicator of the bank’s profitability, was 3.61% in the quarter, compared with 3.19% in the year-ago quarter.
The total capital adequacy ratio of the bank was 16.19% and it does not have any immediate plans to raise capital, said Batra.
Earlier in the week, ICICI’s peer Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd also reported a profit that fell marginally shy of estimates, and joined the country’s largest private lender HDFC Bank in warning of the slowing pace of domestic growth.
The warnings from the private lenders in Asia’s third largest economy, which have been dealing with a large pile of stressed loans, have spooked investors.

Akhtar suggested in his response that the filmmaker should seek psychiatric help.
On Saturday, Kapur had written in a tweet, “Started life as refugee of Partition. Parents gave everything to make a life for kids. Was always in fear of ‘intellectuals’. They made me feel insignificant. Small. Then suddenly embraced me after my films. I still fear them. Their embrace is like a bite of snake. Still a refugee.”
Akhtar wrote back, “Who are these intellectuals who embraced you and you found that embrace like a snake’s bite? Shyam Benegal , Adoor Gopal Krishna , Ram Chandra Guha? Really? Shekhar saheb you are not well . You need help. Come on, there is no shame in meeting a good psychiatrist.”
He added, “What do you mean by still a refugee Does it mean that you feel like an outsider n not an Indian and you don’t feel that this is your motherland. If in India you are still a refugee where will you not feel like a refugee ,In Pakistan? Cut this melodrama you poor rich but lonely guy.”
He continued, “You introduce yourself as neither prejudiced by the past nor afraid of the future living in this moment and in the same breath you say you are a refugee of partition and still a refugee. One doesn’t need a magnifying glass to see the contradiction.”
The disagreement comes in the wake of a letter signed by 49 intellectuals, artists and professionals addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him to take action against mob lynchings against minorities in the country. This was followed by a rebuttal by a separate faction of 62 eminent personalities including Kangana Ranaut and Prasoon Joshi, who claimed that this was a case of ‘selective outrage’.

Anmol Sharma,"BCCI confirms Kohli to hold press conference on Monday, shares details",The BCCI has confirmed that Virat Kohli will hold a pre-departure press conference before leaving for West Indies tour. The BCCI stated Kohli will address the press conference at Mumbai's ITC Maratha at 6 PM on Monday. This comes after several reports stated that Kohli had decided against holding the press conference amid rumours of his rift with Rohit Sharma.,https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/article/indian-captain-virat-kohli-to-hold-pre-departure-press-conference-in-mumbai-ahead-of-india-tour-of-west-indies/460089?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,"Indian captain Virat Kohli will be addressing a press conference on the eve of team's departure for the upcoming West Indies tour on Monday, contrary to several media reports which claimed he might give it a miss. Amid speculations of a rift between Kohli and vice-captain Rohit Sharma, questions over the said unsettled atmosphere in the Indian cricket team's dressing room are expected to take over the media interaction. After India's semi-final exit from ICC World Cup 2019, Kohli's captaincy was put under scrutiny with several media reports claiming that all was not well between the skipper and his deputy.
However, Kohli and Rohit remain an integral part of the Indian team. There were also claims that the selection committee might consider the option of split captaincy by handing over the ODI leadership to Rohit, who many experts even backed to take over the reins from Kohli. However, rubbishing all such rumours the selection panel headed by MSK Prasad, earlier this week announced the squads for the West Indies tour while confirming Kohli as the captain in all three formats.
There were several reports claiming that Kohli might snub the pre-departure pressure owing to explanations on the speculated division in the Indian dressing room, however, the Indian skipper will talk to the media on Monday, confirmed a BCCI press release. Kohli has so far enjoyed great success as a captain having led India to historic Test series win in Australia and ODI series victories in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.
However, he is yet to prove his mettle in major ICC events after India's failure in the knockout stages of two big tournaments - Champions Trophy 2017 and World Cup 2019. Kohli was in fine form with the bat in the recently-concluded World Cup where he notched up 443 runs in nine games at an average of over 55. He will be looking to carry his purple patch into the Windies series as India look for a fresh start after a disappointing exit from the showpiece event.
India are scheduled to play three T20Is, as many ODIs and two Test matches against West Indies starting from August 3. The Men in Blue will play two T20Is in Florida before heading to the Caribbean to play the rest of the matches. The selectors have included several young promising talents in the squad in a bid to identify the right players for future with the World T20 to be staged next year.

Utkarsh Kumar,I can play a big part in 2019 Ashes: Australia pacer Siddle,"Talking ahead of 2019 Ashes which commences on Thursday, Australia pacer Peter Siddle said, ""I think I can play a big part in this series."" The 34-year-old, who has taken 214 wickets in 64 Tests, added, ""I'm definitely bowling a lot better...in these [English] conditions."" Siddle further said that playing with English county side Essex helped him learn a lot.",https://www.cricket.com.au/news/peter-siddle-justin-langer-2015-australia-england-ashes-injury-jimmy-anderson-stuart-broad/2019-07-28?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts ,"Justin Langer received uncomfortably clear confirmation of the fighting qualities within Peter Siddle when the raw young quick played his first Sheffield Shield game more than a dozen years ago.
But it was with bat, rather than shiny new ball in hand that the then 22-year-old came to the attention of the current men's team coach, who has remained an enduring presence in Siddle's career ever since.
As Langer's Western Australia pressed for victory at the MCG in a 2006-07 match the recently retired Test opener had dominated (scoring 108 and 99), Siddle hung in for more than an hour to salvage a draw in partnership with Victoria's number 11 batter, Darren Pattinson (older brother of Australia quick, James Pattinson).
Langer might have cursed Siddle's doggedness that afternoon, but when he was appointed Test team batting coach soon after, he forged a strong bond with Siddle.
It's no surprise, therefore, that in pulling together his first Ashes squad since taking over the senior coaching role last year, Langer has called on the services of the now 34-year-old Siddle who has become something of a master at bowling in English conditions.
For his part, Siddle credits Langer for helping to keep the competitive flame kindling within him after a frustrating 2015 Ashes tour and then a serious back injury the following year that left him doubting if he would ever again don his treasured Baggy Green Cap.
Having spent more than 12 months regaining fitness and form, Siddle took up a playing contract with county team Essex in 2018, not long after Langer assumed the role of national coach.
Siddle recalled today how a simple, single line text message that arrived from Langer after the seamer turned in another impressive performance for Essex was sufficient to reboot his quest to play more Tests.
""He said 'just remember that every game counts' … and that's what I've done,"" Siddle said, a day after learning of his inclusion in Australia's 17-man squad for the Ashes series that gets underway at Edgbaston on Thursday.
""I'm definitely bowling a lot better than I ever have in these (English) conditions, and that's the best thing I bring to this team now.
""I know I've done well. I've got a pretty good record in Ashes Test matches in England, but through my experience over the last couple of years (with Essex) I've learned a lot of new skills.
""So I think I can play a big part in this series.""
It's a vastly different mindset to that which Siddle carried during the latter stages of his previous Ashes tour to the UK, in 2015.
Having shown his suitability to bowling with the Dukes brand ball in English conditions during a term with county team Nottinghamshire the previous northern summer, Siddle was seen as a perfect fit for the crucial fourth Test of the 2015 Ashes campaign at his former home ground, Trent Bridge.
On a humid, cloudy morning with the pitch that Siddle knew so well showing a seamer's delight, he was overlooked and watched from the dressing room as his Notts teammate Stuart Broad tore through Australia in the first session to claim 8-15.
As Siddle remembers, it was the lowest point of a cricket career that has known its share of setbacks.
""It was very tough, it's probably one of the toughest times,"" Siddle said today.
""I know injuries are always a tough thing, you can deal with that and it's not too bad.
""But I think missing out on opportunities … you always believe you should be picked, that's how you should feel, but when you see conditions that are suited to you, that's when it hurts the most.
""I remember at Trent Bridge just after being told I wasn't part of that Test match, the boys were warming up and I went and had a conversation with Punter (Ricky Ponting, working as a television commentator) out in the middle of the field.
""We were looking at the wicket and he couldn’t believe that I wasn't playing, and that's when I said to him 'if I'm not getting picked here, I don't think I'll ever get picked again'.
""And that was the honest truth - I thought at that time I mightn't get another opportunity to play.""
As events transpired, fellow quick Josh Hazlewood was ruled out of the final Test at The Oval two weeks later and Siddle was recalled, taking six wickets in Australia's consolation win by an innings and 46 runs.
However, barely six months later, Siddle was sidelined with stress fractures in his back and that problem flared again later in 2016 when he took the opportunity to also undergo surgery on an ankle problem that had long plagued him.
Given he was already on the far side of 30, and had struggled to reach his previous bowling speeds immediately prior to the injury, Siddle understood there was a strong chance his days of playing international cricket were done.
But ever the optimist, he also viewed the enforced break as a chance to reset the clock and refocus his aspirations.
""That last injury I had when I wrecked my ankle and hurt my back at the same time, it probably came at the right time,"" Siddle said.
""I think if it had of been a year or two later, it would have been hard to come back from there, and I probably would have been done.
""But it gave me just a little chance, a little window to have another crack at trying to represent Australia.
""I had a good 15 months where I could freshen up and get it 100 per cent right and get fit, which I hadn’t been in a long time, to a position now where I think I'm consistently hitting good (bowling) speeds.""
What Siddle has also learned from his time in county cricket – firstly alongside Broad at Nottinghamshire, and now with ex-England Test skipper Sir Alastair Cook at Essex – is to never discount a player on the basis of age.
He points to James Anderson, England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker who turns 37 on Tuesday, as the shining example of a fast bowler who has proved even more potent in the autumn years of his career.
It's not only the skills that Anderson has honed throughout a 16-year Test career that serve him so well, but also his capacity to read and react to all manner of ambient and match conditions, Siddle believes.
And that's a trait that he shares with 33-year-old Broad, England's second-highest all-time Test wicket-taker and the other half of the most successful new-ball pairing the game has seen.
Siddle claimed that if he and his fellow Australia quicks can emulate the skills and the smarts of Anderson and Broad, they could be well on the way to their first Ashes series win on British soil since 2001.
""(Anderson) plays the conditions well, he understands the overheads, the wickets, what it looks like, the times that they're bowling,"" Siddle said.
""He knows whether to be really aggressive and try to take wickets, or hold back a little bit and try to contain and build pressure and get wickets as a team.
""I think that's one of the big keys in England.
""When I've played my stints on the county circuit, that's the main basis of the team set-up.
""If the conditions are right you be can really aggressive and try and take wickets, and then there are other times when the sun's out and the wicket has dulled a little bit, and there mightn't be as much happening.
""So you might have to be patient and build pressure.
""He and Broad together have shown, over the years, that by doing that they can have great results and I think that's something we can take out of it.
""Their game plan - we can try and mimic that throughout this series, and I think the closer we can get to being like that gives us our best chance.""

The start of this game was delayed by about 90 minutes resulting in the game being reduced to 12-overs per team. “Play has been delayed due to some technical reasons,” the organisers of the T20 league tweeted 20 minutes after the scheduled start of play.On the other hand, the official broadcaster of the Global T20 Canada shared that the play was delayed due to ‘security issues’. However, there hasn’t been much clarity about the actual reason for this delay. Since then, there have been various speculations but it is now concluded that the start was delayed due to a ‘bomb threat’. Fans, who were standing in long queues outside the CAA Centre in Brampton, Ontario weren’t allowed to enter the ground. As per the reports from ESPNCricinfo, they contacted a few players to know the reason behind the delay. It was learnt that a suspicious package was left unattended at the venue. Immediately, the police closed the venue for inspection and even deployed bomb-sniffing dogs.“Routine sniffer dogs checks found a substance that alerted security,” one player told ESPNcricinfo. Moreover, another source revealed that a hole was found in a temporarily constructed perimeter fence that surrounds the cricket portion of the facility. Thus, this raised an alarm and the local police took some preventive measures.After this package was deemed not dangerous, the players were allowed to enter the ground and begin their warm-ups. Later, the reduced match was played without any further interruptions. Montreal Tigers were put in to bat first in this match. Courtesy a 30-ball 59 from Sunil Narine and an unbeaten 23-ball 40 from Anton Devcich helped the team get to 135/3 in 12 overs.The Winnipeg Hawks failed to reach the target in the chase. Umar Akmal and JP Duminy were the only two batsmen who played well. They scored 49 off 30 and 30 off 14 respectively. However, the other batsmen tried to go hard and lost their wickets in the process. The side could only get to 111/5 and lost the game by 24 runs."

The desire to allow drivers and passengers to watch video is not a total surprise - Musk noted at E3 that the ability to watch YouTube was coming, The Verge said. Tesla has already unveiled games that drivers can play on the displays in their cars. The games also only work when the car is stationary, so that the player can use the steering wheel as a controller. On Friday, the company announced that chess game is also coming to the Tesla Arcade. But there are huge concerns that come along with such features. Test vehicles are required to have a driver behind the wheel to take over in case something goes wrong, and even as self-driving technology improves, it’s hard to imagine that going away completely, the report said. In March 2017, an Uber self-driving car crashed into pedestrian in Arizona as the driver was watching The Voice on content streaming platform Hulu and lost track of the road."
